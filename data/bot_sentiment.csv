"by far the WORST effort at chain mexican food. I thought this was a sister restaurant of the The Lime ( now called the Green Lemon)  and gave it a shot.  Terrible food. My wife gave me a bit of her guacamole and it tasted like water mush. one their smoky salsas tasted metallic.   DO NOT GO!!!",-0.8079
"Service sucks!  We had a party of 12.  We couldn't get enough chips.  We got 1!  I ordered table side guacamole and had to ask for chips.  We couldn't get drinks.  Waitress couldn't keep focused on each person and was very scattered.  Won't be back for the spendy Mexican food.",-0.3753

"Will not go back. I had high hopes. A friend recommended it and husband had had lunch here a few times but this was not a great experience. Our waitress was flakey, Drinks mixed up and delivered to the wrong Table. Got Guacamole and no chips. Son's chicken fingers had and odd taste (like fried in old oil and too much flour). Other son ordered Mixtos (steak, pork and chorizo) skillet tacos and  now had an upset stomach. I had the shrimp and crab bake and it tastes like fake crab... and too much cheese. Overall disappointed and underwhelmed. But my jalapeño margarita was good.",-0.948
"El peor servicio al cliente que he visto en mi vida! Hice una orden de 2 tacos, un tamal y unos chips con queso. Tras de que se tardaron habían personas que llegaron después de mi y ya estaban comiendo. Luego de esperar casi media hora por unos simples tacos voy al counter para que me devuelvan el dinero porque no quería mi orden ya que nunca llegó. En ningún momento se disculparon conmigo por la tardanza, ni me dieron la razón y tras de eso son tan poco profesionales que sabiendo lo molesta que estaba y que había posibilidad de que no volviera no hicieron ni un mísero intento por retenerme como su cliente, al contrario, como ya me habían dado un refresco en lo que esperaba la comida pues me dieron el reembolso completo de mi dinero pero luego me cobraron el refresco! Su idea de marketing está por el suelo! Nunca mas volveré a ese lugar. Muy desagradable experiencia como para querer volver. Han perdido no solo a mi como cliente sino a todo el que me pregunte por su negocio.


The worst customer service I have seen in my life! I made an order of 2 tacos, a tamale and some chips with cheese. After they were late there were people who arrived after me and were already eating. After waiting almost half an hour for a few simple tacos I go to the counter to get my money back because I did not want my order since it never arrived. At no time did they apologize to me for the delay, nor did they give me the reason and after that they are so unprofessional that knowing how upset I was and that there was a possibility that I would not return they did not make a miserable attempt to keep me as their client, On the contrary, as I had already been given a soda in what I expected the food, they gave me a full refund of my money but then they charged me the soda! Your marketing idea is on the ground! I will never go back to that place again. Very unpleasant experience to want to return. They have lost not only my client but also everyone who asks me about their business.",-0.9681

"Awful service, stood at host station for 10min before a single server helped us. Once our hostess artived we were greeted with, 'what do u want?"" No line at all and about 2/3 of all the tables empty, was told it was a 25min wait.  Wait for what? Wouldn't u rather seat us and make money off of drinks? We waited 5min until some friends of our hostess came in and we're seated immediately. I politely asked if we could at least wait at one of 20 open tables.  Was told they have no tables available, which was ridiculous.  Watched about half a dozen servers standing around the main area talking and not doing anything for about 10minutes. Then we left.",-0.7219
"I don't know why you people are all here lying to people. I got the fish tacos, they are absolutely disgusting. Is the fish boiled? Who boils fish for tacos? Because that is literally what this tastes like. Irrelevant, it is still Bland and tasteless. Also, I asked for flour tortillas, and I still got corn so thank you for that. And then the tortilla completely disintegrates on contact: what the heck is happening here?? Biggest waste of money ever, and into the trash it goes. I guess the hunt for good taco spots in town continues.",-0.4959
"This has got to be one of the worst Mexican experiences that we've ever had. It was 4:30 pm and we had just flown back into town. Decided to try the place because we see it all the time when we eat at Carrabas. We walk in and see one employee sitting at the bar --reading a paperback. He looks up and says, ""Oh, just sit anywhere. "". We sat ourselves and menus were brought to us. About 10 minutes later, he got up and asked if we wanted to order. By this time, we really didn't, but were already invested in the bad experience, that we went ahead and ordered. The food took forever  and was horrible. The sauce tasted like someone opened a can of Hunts tomato sauce and poured it on the enchiladas. There were no refills of drinks, and I had to go get him (still reading his novel) when it was time for us to pay. I thought, ""What a slug"". Horrible service, horrible food, and horrible experience. The place was so mismanaged -- rest room was filthy, from training of employees to quality of food. It has the air of a place on its way out, rather than on its way to the top. I recommend that you avoid this place.",-0.9794
"We had the rudest waiter ever. No refills for anyone at our table.   It took over an hour to get our check after asking and  then another 45 minutes to get my card back. I have never considered walking out on a check before this.",-0.6908
"Yelpers have seriously dropped the ball on this one, I just wasted an hour and a half going to this place only to be served a shit ton of dissatisfaction. First, they flat out lied to me that they could not validate my restaurant.com certificate. My bad, I guess I should've listened to the one yelper that shared the same experience. Don't bother ordering $10 shrimp tacos, the shrimp are flavorless and the ""soft corn tacos"" were an abomination that I really don't know how to describe properly. I had heard such great things about their ceviche, so i decided to order the campechana. It is now sitting in my refrigerator until I figure out a way to salvage the shrimp from that disaster. The octopus is a total loss though. If you don't know how to prepare octopus without turning it into shoe leather,  do not serve it at your establishment. I honestly feel embarrassed for these people. I'm pretty certain it's generally a bad idea to throw some seafood in a cup with a bunch of ketchup and sugar, and have the balls to think that it's ok. If I could give negative stars, I would. I hope this place shuts down. The only positive is that my senior citizen relative enjoyed the asada burrito. If she had been disappointed I probably would have written a much longer review of this nightmare. It is a disgrace to food trucks across this great nation. Save your money and ffs don't support this madness.",-0.9393
"This place will last six months, tops. Slow service, terrible food, uncaring servers. It isn't that difficult to make decent Mexican food but this place fails on so many levels. I'm not really a picky eater but the food was over salted, lacking spice and flavor, served Luke warm/cold and basically a mound of lettuce. The meat quality is poor and the queso is gross... Seriously how do you mess up queso? I honestly rather eat Taco Bell. I live within walking distance to this place and am rooting for Channelside but sadly my hopes for the plaza are dismal. Channelside, be careful about who you are choosing to put in your plaza! I will not be returning.",-0.9244
"The worst and I didn't even get to eat. I was standing for 5 min at the door and they finally told the people in front of me it would be a 30 min wait. That was 2 people. I walked up and said I was alone and she immediately told me it was an hour and a half wait. If my money isn't good enough when I'm a party of one I question your business ethics because crap like that comes from the top. South Tampa is becoming a joke and all about the cash.",-0.4416
"I eat here more than I probably should. And they screw up my order at least 50% of the time. They don't seem to understand the request ""hold the onions"".",-0.1027
"This place was horrible.. We will never eat here again.

Salsa had a white pubic hair and when we told our server he denied that it was a pubic hair & that it was from the onion that they add to salsa.

food not good. tostada was not crunchy, it was saggy and that is not how its suppose to be. 

chile relleno barely did had chile, you cannot even taste chile. it was just ground beef and 2 small piece of chile not like what i'm used to that you can actually see the whole chile stuffed with cheese and meat.",-0.7518
"It's Taco Bell. It's crap food, terrible service. Literally the only expectation is that the place is open when advertised. This place isn't. We went 20 minutes out of our way to get here to be told they weren't serving food, 20 minutes before they closed. The owner of this franchise should go bankrupt. He hires unqualified managers I would fire immediately.",-0.8934
"I live around the corner and thought this was going to be a fresh new restaurant in the failing district. The end result was $20 worth of what seemed like Gordo's cheese dip. Unbelievable. The server claimed it was made in house but there is no way. I eat this queso brand from Publix twice a week and there is no mistaking the decent, yet processed taste. Pairing this with the earlier review saying the restaurant ran out of queso yesterday, it may not be a coincidence.  I didn't have the heart to try the tacos. Maybe one day.",-0.7311
"Once again customer service or should I say bad customer service strikes again.  What is it with employees just looking at you with a blank stare and not speaking to you when you walk up to place an order?

That's just what happened here.  Mom and I walked up and about four employees chatting and not acknowledging us.  I ask him if he's ready and he just smiles.  I'm assuming the man with braids that told us the cashier with the blank stare would be right with us was the manager. Placed order and repeated it over and over and over until he got it right. Come on people......it's your job to serve.",-0.1027
"Disappointed tonight.  Sat at the bar for 5 minutes.  No service.  No one said a word to me.  No verbal acknowledgement.  Walked out gave my business elsewhere",-0.8271
"Worst customer service ever! We came in and sat for about 15 mins until the server came by and then after taking the order we waited 10 minutes just waiting on the waters. I forgot to mention we were a table of 4. Not a big party. So after being there for 25 mins we left without getting anything that we ordered not even the water. First time in this place and never coming back",-0.7684
"Terrible bar service.  Margaritas on rocks with no salt.  Took about 15 minutes to get our drinks/be waited on... and they were all ice. Female bartender looked like she hated her job and questioned us about the chips and salsa placed in front of us that we didn't order.  Drinks weren't good- all ice; salsa sucked.  We won't be back to eat or drink there.  

Call John Taffer, this place wouldn't survive a ""Bar Rescue"" undercover investigation.",-0.9383
"What the heck has happened to this place?? Use to be a reliable favorite but not any more.  Sat at the bar for 20 minutes and never even acknowledged... While waiting, heard several complaints regarding slow and incompetent service.  Too bad, this place was great...",-0.9154
"The fish tacos were very bland and you can't call the quesadilla a quesadilla who knows what that was and it wasn't good. We had to ask for napkins and silverware in a cup on table not cute or sanitary. Not a very good dining experience. However it gets a star because the sangria margarita was good.",-0.827
"WORST SERVICE EVER. Never even got our food; we waited over 30min for our food to arrive.  Come to find out when I went up to ask for my money back, the young lady behind the counter asked where the ""ticket for Tina is"" the other girl said ""I dont see one"". Seriously? Where has good customer service gone? Practically the entire staff walked past us at some point and not one person asked if my husband would like more tea, or said ""you haven't gotten your food yet?"" To check.  I had to rate them a star in order to leave a comment but in my opinion they get zero stars.",-0.1525
"I had high hopes. This place is about 5 minutes from where I live, so I figured I'd give it a try. I immediately thought it seemed like a Tijuana Flats wannabee. Sadly, it will remain a wannabee.

The entrance is hard to find. You have go on Fowler, and then turn in where Applebee's and Coca-Cola are located. It has indoor seating. and part of the the restaurant in open, leading to outside bench seating. You go up to the counter to place your order.

I gave this place two tries before reviewing. Both times it was disappointing. The first time I ordered the beef nachos. The ""nachos"" were tortilla chips with a little bit of feta cheese and I guess some beef. It took a long time to get our order, and the staff didn't know what went where. My boyfriend (who used to work in a restaurant), felt like he was working there. He had to go up to the kitchen window to get the food, which was wrong, and then had to read out the actual order. So, your customers are part of the staff? Additionally, they had a lot of staff of there, so what were they doing? The second time was possibly worse. Slow service again. My ""quesadilla"" was not filled with much of anything. The presentation is non-existent. I was told it looked like prison food. My food was served on a metal tray, and my side of sour cream was a blob on parchment paper. Both times I left hungry and unsatisfied.",-0.8645
"Myself and my family visited the restaurant Saturday evening around 8pm.  I ordered  2 steak nachos for dine in. We waited about 20minutes, and the food  came out, which was a nacho and a taco salad. I told the guy that brought the food to the table that the order was not correct and what it should have been.  While he was trying to find out what the mixup was, I tasted the steak nachos that he brought out.  The food was terrible!  When he came back over he said that I was charged for a taco salad and said that I would have to pay the difference for another nacho.  I said that was fine but I told him that the steak was chewy and tasted stale and old.  I asked if  I could get fresh steak and he said"" it was made today"".  Sooo, since I couldn't get it cooked fresh,  I asked for beef. I asked what kind of beef it was and the guy said shredded so I said I""ll have that with no onion.  10 mins later a different person comes to the table and asks me If I ordered steak nachos, no onion.  I told him No that I didnt like the steak and I wanted the beef.  So he leaves the table and goes back behind the counter and I hear all the employees talking(in Spanish of course).  Then, they sent a  third person to the  table and tell me  that they already made the steak nacho and they are just going to give me my money  back.  I told the worker, why If I didnt like the steak why I would order it again??  I told him to just give me my  money  back and that I would never be back and I would write a bad review.  While I am waiting on  my refund, I hear the worker telling everyone in the back that I said that I would write a bad review.  He was mocking me and told his co workers that he said ok.  I will never in life visit this establishment again,  nor will I refer anyone.  The service was terrible and the food was just as bad.  Customers are always # one, and they do come first.  This first time visit, turned a new customer into a never to return one!! All around bad experience!!   I had to leave a star to leave the review but I give Taco Sun In Tampa 0 Stars",-0.9899
"Was one of my favorite spots until the over charged me and I went to speak with management. The staff needs to take a course on how to properly deal with situations like this. I won't be returning, nor will anyone I know. Very unprofessional and very disappointing.",-0.5245
"I'm so easy to please when it comes to Mexican food, and this place was the worst.  The entire dining experience can be summed up by the following interaction with our server at the end of the meal:
""Did you enjoy the food?""
""Ehhhhhh.......""
""Yeah we've been getting a lot of complaints!  We're new so we have a lot to work on.  Should I bring your check?""

They're bad, they know it, and they don't care.  A run-down of what went wrong:
- Upon arriving, we're told all of the things they are out of.  (Almost half the menu)
- I order one of the remaining items, and am told they're out of that too.
- Server comes to our table to express surprise that we don't have our food yet.
- Server brings our food, both orders are wrong, but she's gone before we can let her know.
- Server is nowhere to be found, I eventually go inside and ask a bartender to please send our server over. (We sat on the patio)
- My problem would have been easily fixable (missing salsa) but server takes so long in getting a cup of salsa that my food has gone from barely lukewarm to very cold by the time I have my complete order.
- My boyfriend's dish had to be completely remade.  This is the amount of time I waited to receive the salsa that was missing from my tacos.  (At least his was served hot, unlike mine)
- The above mentioned exchange regarding the poor dining experience.
- Server drops off my credit card receipts to sign, with no pen, so again I'm inside at the bar asking for a pen.

When a customer tells you they're dissatisfied with their meal, do SOMETHING.  Take something off their bill,  Give them a free dessert.  Give them a coupon to come give you another chance.  But to just say ""Yeah, we've been getting a lot of complaints!"" is unacceptable.  I doubt this place will be around for long, and I'm fine with that.",-0.8843
"I decided to go here last night (02-11-16) because i didnt want the typical fast food i really was craving nachos plus my 2 older sisters always talked about ""how great"" the food was here. So i said hey why not thinking that my experience here would be like their experience if not better but boy was i wrong. I ordered the nacho supreme with steak and also the shrimp ceviche and it was not what i thought it was going to be. Nachos-the top layer of chips were ok but as i got to the middle of the pile they started having this burnt funny taste to them. So i thought maybe its just these one or 2 chips but as i started picking towards the bottom of the pile the taste got more and more pungent on my tongue so much that i couldve even focus on any of the other flavors. Scratched the chips out of the equation- so i just used my spoon to eat the toppings. Everything was good until i ate the steak, oh excuse me the beef jerky. That steak was so dry rubbery and inedible that i gave up altogether on the nachos, it was a loss cause... I was super pissed that i couldn't even enjoy it. So i figured the ceviche would make up for such a bad experience with the nachos. Wrong again!!! The first taste of the ceviche was so powerful i thought i was eating sour candy. My mouth filled up with so much saliva from eating this overly lime tasting dish i was almost in tears. I thought ok maybe i should stir it up considering i just took the top of and jumped right in. Stiring stiring stiring just to make sure stir again....  Grabs chips dips in (just the sauce) bites the chips... Mouth goes in eyes start watering spits it out... Grabs another chip get just a shrimp (maybe its the sauce) bites the chips miss again.... Im so disappointed in this its crazy... So i told my nephew if he wanted it he could have it but I went to bed mad hungry and with a bad taste in my mouth (in more ways then one)... Lets just say the food went  in the trash this morning after my nephew told me his jaw was hurting after trying to eat the ""mystery meat"" (and he's 10) so i dont think that ill go back here...",-0.8511
"I wish I could give them negative stars but since 1 is the minimum I guess it will do. We sat down for 15 minutes and no waiters came to our table. Meanwhile, another table sat right next to ours and miraculously their waiter appeared immediately. Our waiter finally showed up and we placed our drink orders along with food. After waiting for another 15-20 minutes our order had still not made it to our table while our waiter was busy talking with the table next to ours. I tried to get her attention but obviously the conversation with her other customers was more important than attending other patrons. All in all, terrible customer service to the point where my family and I just got up and left without water, drinks or food all after a 30 minutes wait.",-0.7013

Apologized... no more.  STAY AWAY. Try the TF in Oldsmar... I hear they are much better and know how to treat their customers. This Westchase location is a disgrace as is their servers. Jason... shame on you. Please do the right thing the next time for your next customer. Stop serving DRY chicken.  I am sure a salsa would not break the bank. Instead  what you did is lose a customer.  I will be sure to tell all my neighbors to go to Oldsmar. Good luck Jason...   you will really need it  with the customer service that you provided.

Taco shells were cold, never heated and the re-fried beans had no taste to them as well as nothing much in the taco, just some iceberg lettuce.  Salsa was watery and I had to try to use that for some taste in the taco which made it a complete mess.  This isn't Mexican food one bit as there is no taste to it.

"Was staying at hotel across street, got in late(11pm) and hadn't had dinner yet. Hotel restaurant was closed already and other restaurants within walking distance were closed as well. Hotel staff suggested the Taco Bell across street was open late.

Walked across street to Taco Bell. Sit down area was closed but drive-thru was still open and doing business.

Walked over to Drive-thru to place order. No one at the order location box would respond. Walked over to pickup window.

A Taco Bell employee opens the window and says, ""We don't serve walk ups"".

Explained that I was staying at hotel across street and showed him I had cash (to pay for my meal). He repeats same line and just stands there with the window open.

I plead my case about I hadn't had dinner yet and was just trying to get a late night meal. He just stands there and repeats the same line again about not serving walk ups.

I don't know what this guy's problem was. If they're afraid of getting robbed, I showed him I had cash and fact he's standing there with the window wide OPEN, that doesn't appear to be the case.

There was NO ONE in line behind me and NO signs that they don't serve walk ups.

I wave the floor manager over and he takes a towel and grabs it and walks away.  Doesn't  say sorry or nothing!  We all look at each other and we're like ""let's go"".  Can u believe they brought us the check and made us pay full price.  Never again......",-0.2677

"Worst experience. We went for cinco de mayo. That being said it wasn't even that crazy. They were obviously featuring margaritas on their specials. They were the WORST I have ever had. Way to much sour mix, odd flavor.... and no salt rim. Bartender was ASTOUNDED and rude when I said I wanted a salt rim... yeah won't be back",-0.8646
"Had real bad service ordered 5 chicken tacos and on 5 separate occasions they couldn't get the order correct. Finally on 5 order I gave up. Then in this whole thing a lady from the back comes out and proceeds to yell at me because she can't get the order correct.  I think the best is when she brought me 3 tacos and said here is your 5 tacos; insult my intelligence like I can't count.  Well if you want bad service, food and yelled at then stop by this place!",-0.5432
"So, as Lightning season ticket holders, we were thrilled to hear about a new dining option. Stopped in at 2:20pm before a 5pm game. Lots of tables open, but we were told we couldn't be seated due to lack of wait staff. We asked if we could sit and have a drink and we would wait for food. The hostess went to ask someone if that would be ok. While she was gone, another hostess say a couple immediately! Our hostess returned to say she could seat is, but couldn't serve us drinks right away, and would then move us to order. What???!  We walked out. 
I don't care that you just opened, which the hostess explained was the problem. You just lost 3 patrons that will tell 20 people each, not to eat at your ealstablishment. Way to go Hablo Taco, you could and should have handled this situation in a much different way.",-0.8937

Wife ordered Steak tacos that clearly came out as Barbacao.  However, this may have been the driest barbacao I have ever had.  Nevermind that it wasn't even what she ordered....It literally was hard to swallow because of how dry it was. 

Had a Gringo dip as well...and I must have been a gringo for ordering it.  Disgusting.

"The food is good but the staff is not. Had the most uncomfortable dining experience with the waitress telling us her life story on how she has no money and everybody at the restaurant makes fun of her. The drinks were wrong. The food was wrong. Had to use our same cup for all you can drink margaritas and they got messed up. As it unfolded, the management watched everything yet didn't handle it and wouldn't help the poor girl even after all the mistakes. The bills were wrong. In fact, someone from our table went into the kitchen to fix the bills correctly. Hot mess express. And we paid full price for our meals despite it being a disaster.",-0.9546
"Now I see why this location has such terrible reviews. They never have steady workers and are constantly having new people and 7-10x they are friendly. Except for today. Went through the drive through and it was taking longer than normal. No biggie. Placed my order and she missed an item and got irritated with me as I brought it to her attention. She told me my tolls and asked me to pull up. Again, waited my turn as it took longer than normal. Once I got to the window you could tell she was irritated and did not want to be there. Handed her a $20 as she gave me my change. Asked if I wanted hot sauce I said, ""yes please! Lots of hot."" She went about her business than said, ""you want fire right"" I said, ""no. Hot please"" I was handed my bag as she was talking on the intercom. I looked in my bag as I had ordered 5 items they were all there with 3 packs of hot sauce. I politely waited until she was done speaking and asked for more hot sauce. She got upset and said it's in the bag. I said yes, 3 May I please have more. So, she rudely hands me 3more. So of course I say nvm I will just go inside and get them myself. ASI Park and walk in I hear he talking about me with the other coworkers and thinking it was funny that she gave me so few.

The food had no flavor whatsoever, I got the steak salad and my bf got the steak burrito. The steak was bad quality and overcooked. The salsa bar is only there to overcompensate for the bad food. The only reason I gave this place a star was because the girl at the front desk was very pleasant and patient with us while we decided what we wanted.",-0.8932

Nothing was subtle: loud, over the top presentations with creams drizzled zig zag, cotija cheese on everything, sauces that either under delivered (salsa) or were way too cloying to eat (the piquin sauce mixed with tomatillos in the heavy, salty short rib overpriced -$26-entree mess). Please have chefs visit the much more modest El Puerto in Ybor City for a master class lesson in making black beans. I mean, how do you ruin this?

Appetizers: the ahi poke bowl, served with an old avocado and cucumbers. And the tuna looked rotten (friend sent back).  Entrees: salad bowl was served with refried beans which was not listed on the menu. And the beans were not in the bowl it was spread on the bottom of the plate. I almost thought the salad bowl was served on a dirty plate. I wouldn't be surprised at this point.  The chicken burrito was filled with rice and very little chicken. The sauce was drizzled on the outside which made it very difficult to eat or impossible to hold.  Very disappointing food. I would not recommend this joint.",-0.9529

"I can not believe the high ratings for this place. Yelp, you failed me today! You failed me BAD!!! The food here was so bad that it put me in a bad mood. First of all, I love a hole-in-the-wall, family run place. It has never failed me. But there's a first for everything.  $31 for 3 tacos, a stuff pepper bowl, corn and some chips. All the meats (al pastor, steak & shredded pork) were dried AF. The rice in my bowl was hard as pepples. And the stuff pepper was just gross. I never return food, but today I was going to. I couldn't though... because they had 1 guy at the counter servicing the entire restaurant and taking phone orders. I originally waited 15-20mins to have my order taken because he was taking phone orders. And it took another 30mins to get my food. I just couldn't wait another 30-40 mins before I could get some help. This place is ridiculous. Never again. This experience has ruined Yelp for me. I will never trust yelp again.",-0.9758
"By far THE WORST sad excuse for Mexican food I've ever had. We had a party of 5 and we all hated our meals. I'm fine paying $20+ for Mexican food at Miguel's because it's amazing. The food here was disgusting... extremely bland and the chicken and pork that our table received was so over cooked it was rubbery. The rice and beans were also extremely bland and undercooked. Also not really sure why they put pepitas into the rice...Also, the ""rice and beans for the table"" is smaller than a side for one person. Luckily it wasn't good so we didn't eat it, but two sides of rice of beans would not have been enough for 5 people. I'm truly shocked how this place had such high reviews with such terrible overpriced food. I'm assuming everyone is drunk on margaritas before eating the terrible food. We took a vote at the table and we all would have rather had Taco Bell than eat at Besito. On top of the terrible food, our server only came by the table twice. To take our food and drink order. She never even came by to check on the table once we got our food. Salsa had been spilled into my water and I was never able to get a new glass. Do not go here.

Then a very very rude little brat who works there asked us if we were done with our plates (my friend was still eating, but didn't like it) in a very unfriendly tone then swiped the plates off the table because she wanted to go home. (It was closing time). Well, if my friend didn't have to wait 25 minutes for fast food, we would have been done and out by closing time. Strike two.

"I wish I could take away stars, VERY disappointed. 

I will never go to this location again. Not only did the food suck so did the service. It was our first time there and we were NOT impressed at all. 

Where do I begin? My grilled veggie salad had NO squash,  zucchini, iceberg lettuce not a lettuce blend, and a few black beans. Only veggie I saw was the carrots that were HOT! Let's not mention the HOT melted cheese, I was unaware my salad was a hot salad.

The side of black beans with Pico tasted as they just scooped it out of the can and put a drizzle of Pico on it and served it, not warm or any flavor to it. What a disappointment! 

Special Beef Nachos, nothing special, was cold and chips tasted stale. The queso was with running, cold and NO flavor. 
Fajita Beef Taco had few pieces of meat and the entire soft shell taco fell apart in my hand, could not get a bite. 

Service - the music was SO LOUD I could not hear the cashier to place the order. The staff was unfriendly, rude and it could be considered as very nonprofessional. They did not seem to give a crap about anything.. 

If this is how Fuzzy Taco serves food and treats their customers, I will say they will not survive. 
I left the place still hungry, we could not finish our meal. Thanks for waisting my $20 bucks and being so dissatisfied. 

Oh, BTW, we showed up as the place was opening and there was NO one there yet. That should have been a sign to turn around and go somewhere else.",-0.9775
"Ended up at Besito for a friend's birthday! Asked for any signature drink and the bartender said no and finally offered their besito margarita! They claim being fresh pomegranate and taste it like Rasberry Schnapps. Ordered camarones al ajillo didn't taste like garlic at all. When beans arrived I got black beans, really? Isn't that Cuban? No wonder why big chains kill authentic Mexican restaurants because they confuse customers. They were not my favorite either. Their dishes are named familiar but are way far on execution. My friend ordered ribs piquin and they were horrible. My star goes to service the best thing we got the whole night. If you are looking for real authentic Mexican go to Catrinas on Macdill. Sadly Besito's isn't a great example of Mexican food. Horrible representation for Mexican cuisine!",-0.8962

"Experience was bad from the first minute. I tried to give the benefit of the doubt. But it just sucked. From the rude attitude of the person who served the food, to my charred black and burnt fajitas. One person at my table ordered no onions and sure enough it came with onions. We said that we specifically asked for no onions due to an allergy, the Guy goes ""that's the way it comes"". Right, because you can't not add onions right? Taco Bell is literally better than this. Do yourself a favor and go to Chueys or VIP Mexican in st Pete. Vallarta's even. This place was just awful. Oh and the 9 dollar queso dip is the consistency of water.",-0.402
"I really do enjoy Moe's food, but tonight I have had the worst time with this store. 
I ordered a burrito on postmates with several ingredients missing (jalapeño, black olives, sour cream, tomatoes, cilantro, mushrooms etc) missing! 
Just a plain burrito, so I called the store and they said they would remake it for me if I would come pick it up. 
So they said they were writing down everything that was supposed to be on the burrito, but once again when I picked up my food and went home. It was still missing jalapeños, tomatoes, cilantro and mushrooms! 
I'm not happy, and their customer service over the phone was not great. 

Just saying that you should be at the store if you need it made correctly, apparently.",-0.9714

The lettuce was brown, the stuff looked old and once in my mouth...was not hot at all. I'm the moron for eating it. 20 mins later on my birthday I feel sooo sick to my stomach. I hope this doesn't stick around all day. I won't go back to moes ever..even for a free burrito. Sad.",-0.5267
"If I could give NO star  I would! 
Where to start, 
The meat to all the tacos variations are unseasoned and over cooked. So the meat is very dry. 
Next, I order the kids meal that comes with two tacos    and the side of beans and rice. The beans were spoiled and you can smell it. 
I paid for my food, explained to the young lady that the beans went bad. She tells me ""Well no one else has complained "". I stated ""I can bring you my child's plate so you can smell them"". She didn't want to, or at least consider the formal complaint. She then ignores me and moves onto the next customer, mind you I'm standing in front of her! 
I'm not one to complain or pay for my food, but total ignorance is on the next level! 
Food is cheap but be ready for spoiled or over cooked food! 
I don't recommend at all! Only good thing about the place is homemade tortillas. That's all! 
Very disappointing.
An hour later, I threw up everything I ate from this place.",-0.8944

"First of all, the salsa has an odd flavor which was fairly strong. We decided we thought it was garlic. The chicken enchilada Suizas was not good at all. I do not like dark meat chicken and fat chunks in my enchiladas and overall it was bland. One of our party got a salad with grilled chicken and she said it was pretty good. There was a heavy smoke flavor on the chicken but overall she would order it again. I'm not sure what the other 2 people got but both of them said they would not go back.",-0.2392

All around bad experience, not just tonight, but for the last several times.  Done with this location for good.",-0.8271

"I really had very high hopes for this place. I got there and immediatly noticed how busy it was. After waiting 20 minutes we were seated.  A waitress brought out some chips and salsa and we waited. Oh and waited. And waited. And waited. Finally we raised our hand and a waiter came by. We explained it had been 13 minutes since we sat and we had not even ordered drinks because no one came over to help us. He then put both elbows down i. The table and said "" I am busy. I am your waiter. But if you know what you want right now then I will take your order."" He did not even have anytning to write the orders down. He was rude. I mean really unprofessional. We ordered nonetheless. The food took a very long time to come out. When it finally did everything had so much lettuce on it that the actual entrees were swimming in water. I can tell you my enchiladas were microwaves witn some nasty processed cheese in them. The red sauce was foul. It was sour and tasted rotten. I spit my food out. No way was I ingesting that. The guac was most definetly not fresh. Needless to say we sent out food back. Ended up payi g 19.46 for one chimichanga and a beer. Expensive...and disgusting. Our table also had an order of something that had chicken in it. The chicken was NOT fresh. We threw the chimichanga away at home. Not safe to eat. The place was busy but that food is awful. The waiter was absolutely someone who should not be working with the public. I will be sure to tell everyone I know about this nasty place. Yuck.",-0.9903

One of the trademark welcome to Moe's greetings wasn't given. Very disappointing.",-0.5754
"Unfortunately, after years of eating at TacoSon, and constantly bringing people and recommending their establishment, we have had 3 bad experiences in a week and a half. The final straw was going through the drivethru and getting the wrong order read to us when paying $60. 
The assistant manager, who is the owner's son, was argumentative and blamed us for not checking that the order was done correctly. It was their mistake! The owner's son acted as if we were trying to pull one over on him. Said to hand the food back to correct it. At that point there was nothing to correct. 
Never had this kind of experience there...We will not be returning.",-0.92
"This is the worse Taco Bell I have been to in my life! The crew are rude. They argue with customers. They have attitude and act like being decent to the customers is not required from management. The menu was incorrect and they actually sent someone else out to explain the menu to me only to find out it was incorrect after all. I've heard them yelling out of frustration when through the intercom. It's ridiculous! I've tried calling to speak to a manager but their phone doesn't even work.",-0.7494

It was only a 10 minute drive but I guess it can be expected for take out, but the brisket was not good at all. It was clumped together and tasted and looked old, so I fed it to my dog. And to make all of this worse, I found the finger tip from a latex glove in one of my tacos. I just lost my appetite and threw it all away. So I think I'll stay away from now on.",-0.9
"This place is awful. Absolutely awful. I ordered a quesadilla and it came covered in grease. Not one of the people in the process of cooking and delivering the food stopped to look at this disgusting grease covered dish. I'm the whitest white bread person and I could make better Mexican food with my eyes closed. They definitely don't have fresh food, the wait staff doesn't seem to care if they get your order right, the only part about this place that is any good is the mariachi band. 

If this place was anything like Carmelita's off 54 and 19, I would be here every week. 

Unfortunately, this place along with pretty much every other restaurant in this plaza is just a massive disappointment.",-0.79
"I just ordered the nachos supreme. It was the worst that I have ever had, and I have lived in Texas, the southwest, and California, and I have been to Mexico. It wasn't even remotely authentic except for maybe the beef. The menu description says that it includes queso. I had no queso. Not one drop. I specifically asked for jalapenos, It had chopped bell peppers (I tasted them thinking that they might have been chopped jalapenos, but they weren't). The nachos consisted of tortilla chips, beef, onions, tomatoes, onions, chopped bell peppers, and pickled onions, which gave it a weird flavor. No queso, no jalapenos. It was the worst nachos that I have ever had.",-0.9293
"Seated immediate-party of 4 adults, 1child.  Took an hour for our entrees to be delivered to the table and they were delivered partially- it took an extra 10 minutes to get everyone's entree on the table at the same time while we waited for enough silverware, the tortillas that went with the Milanesa, and I never did get the ranchero sauce that was supposed to go on top of my burrito.  My fork was bent at such an angle it couldn't pick up food, my granddaughters lemonade was never refilled. Her order was supposed to be double rice, no beans- you guessed it: rice and beans.  I ate 1 bite of my burrito because it was so soggy from the fillings that had seeped out onto the plate-a pink juice -was that the ranchero sauce????? The fillings were cold, the guacamole salad was 1 tiny strip of an avacado on top of the burrito. Horrible service, horrible food.  The waiter kept telling us the manager would come talk to us.  Nope! Never.  We have gone here many times and it would usually rank a 3-4 star.  Not tonight-horrible service, horrible food, no visit from the manager, just sad.",-0.949
"This place is simply terrible. I haven't an inkling as to how this place was even given 5 stars(unless they're the owner's friends, family members). What they serve is mostly bland, uninspired and the taste is as authentic to Mexican cuisine as taco bell. 
However, if you feel the urge to throw money into a sink and watch those dollars plunge down the drain, go ahead and spend $8 for two ""tacos"" the size of a baby's palm buried under a heap of translucent iceberg lettuce, with some cuts of meat if you're lucky, accompanied by scraps of tomato and sprinkled by a wet pathetic cottage cheese.",-0.4767
"I think the quality of their food has gone down over the years. I ordered the borracho beans and it was the most nauseating thing ever. The rice was flavorless and the tacos were even worst. How does a taco shop mess up beans, rice AND tacos?",-0.765
"Ok, so I hope the manager of this location is watching out for the reviews because the issues have been going on for more than a year and nothing seems to be improving.  The only reason that I decided to write my review is because from seeing the other reviews, it looks as if this location is giving the brand a bad name for first time Moe's visitors!  Not all Moe's are like this one.  I actually LOVE Moe's but HATE this location.  And believe me when I tell you, I have given this location more than a good share of fair chances over the past 2 years since I live close by (my last chance being last night).  They have CONSISTENTLY disappointed every time.  From unfriendly, untrained staff, dried out food, dirty counters, floors, empty salsa stations, no ice, or out of multiple sodas when the store was slow and empty.  Yet the staff was standing around chatting or on their phones and when you nicely advise them that they are out of ice, they act as if you are bothering/inconveniencing THEM in some way!  They mix up orders when there are only TWO people on a line! The chips are under cooked, oil soaked or stale, and the beans, rice and meats sitting at the steam tables are normally always dried out. There is always SOMETHING wrong.  You will NEVER have a good experience here.  SOMETHING will go wrong.  Either they will get your order wrong, their food will be dried, or they will be out of something, or they will give your order to someone else, guaranteed. Management really needs to get someone to manage/run this store more efficiently like the one at Regency Square!  I will not be back to this one again! I'm done!",-0.456

"This was the worse place I have ever been. Everything I ordered was cold, nothing had flavor, the portion size was terrible. I know what Mexican food should look and taste like and this was just disgusting. I spent $69.00 for my family to eat and it was cold. This place needs to be shut down or they need new workers. 
I gave it 1 star but in reality it didn't even deserve the one.",-0.5499
"Every time we go to San Jose, the service is beyond slow. They have so many people working, but they stand at the bar and/or desk and talk with each other. They do not help each other run food etc. when something goes wrong, the staff could seriously care less. They used to be Vallarta's, but switched to San Jose. Vallarta's is not located down the road. I would recommend going to Vallarta's and saving the trouble of having bad service.",-0.8701
"I ordered a combination of taco and enchilada plate with rice and beans. 
I waited 25 min and my order didn't come. There are only few customers and wasn't busy at all. So I asked the girl and when she asked cooks, my meal was in microwave and no one cared. Anyway I started to eat but rice was hard like uncooked. So I asked girl again to change for cooked rice. I felt horrible. Maybe we need to bring back Mexican people so that we can eat edible Mexican food cooked by Mexican people.",-0.4215
"Not only was our waitress ""Carmen H"" rude but she decided to round up her tip on when she ran my credit card! This is technically fraud but as it was 8cents I'm going to be nice and not file a claim with my credit card company. My company have a very firm policy that I cannot tip more than 15% on the company card which is why I left the exact amount I did. Rounding up just 8 cents now puts the tip over the 15% maximum. 

Also, 15% is not an unreasonable tip, especially given the rude service!

For management, the check # is 4836 on Dec 10th 2019 @ 7:30pm. I highly suggest you look up this transaction and fire Carmen for fraud. I doubt this is the only time she's done this.

"This was my first time in Moe's. My friends have always raved about it being better than Chiptole. So on a Sunday night my boyfriend and I stopped in to give it a try. We did get greeted which is one of things I look for when trying a new place. As we got in line to create our burritos the young woman behind the counter was having difficulties hearing as we tried to place our order. It took her 3 times to hear what we actually wanted, which is understandable as it was loud in there. The other woman who stuffed our burritos was extremely slow even though there was only one other people in front of us. Not only was she slow, she was smacking her gum like there was no tomorrow. They are extremely stingy with their stuffing for burritos and they charge extra for chips and a drink when most places would just make it a combo meal. When I looked at my receipt I noticed they charged me extra for another combo meal when I only got one queso and a drink but upgraded my other drink to a large. As I walked backed to the cashier and explained why I got charged extra the young woman asked me what my question was even though I explained to her what the problem was two times. When the young man who rang me up looked over the recipe he noticed he made a mistake. When the  young woman pointed out his mistake he replied with ""Well, I could've just told her no and to get out my store."" What shitty customer service and overpriced food. I wished I never betrayed Chiptole. All in all, this place deserves no stars.",-0.9443
"Came here on a business trip with a group of coworkers. Four of our six meals were incorrect. They never brought parts of one meal, and all of our water glasses stayed empty. When we said that our orders were wrong we were made to feel like it was our fault. It took FOREVER to get our checks and they had to ask multiple times bout who ordered what. They brought us queso that we didn't order, though, and we definitely were charged for that. 

The tacos were okay. Nothing to write home about. We are disappointed with the experience.",-0.6597
"Ordered food from here today. One of the orders was for my 8 year old. I ordered the chicken tenders and it came with applesauce. Thank God my child was smart enough to look at it before she ate. It had a mold growth in it!!! Disgusting and dangerous. It was not expired so i am not sure if it was left out in the heat or whether this is Mott's fault. Either way this is appalling that a small child potentially could've eaten this and got sick!!! I called restaurant they recommended to go through uber eats to get the money back. I hope they don't serve this to anyone else!!!",-0.6362

"Horrible service for a table of 1st time customers with a part of 9. Rude and unprofessional server, food was made even though food allergies were disclosed from the beginning.  Never received 2nd round of drinks ordered,  no refills were offered and they seemed bothered when ever we asked for anything.  My food took over  1 1/2 hours to remake so the whole table was done eating and checks were being paid. When I tried to discuss how upset I was that the food took that long and I received a check for the entree the server was extremely rude. The server told me I was being charged because I was taking the food to go so I told him that he could have it back.  He then snatched it off the table and mumbled under his breath to go adjust the check. I would never go back to this establishment after this treatment.  Food allergies should be taken more seriously here. The staff should have a lot more friendly customer service skills.",-0.9552
"One word...FILTHY!  Salsa bar is consistently empty and unkempt!  The restaurant itself consistently has filthy tables and full garbage cans!  I have given this location a few chances because my kids like it but I feel dirty leaving the place.  The food quality is in line with the cleanliness of the restaurant.",-0.6093
"So first of all, I ordered a beef quesarito and it had A FAKE EYELASH GRILLED ONTO IT!! NOT ONLY THAT, when I called the lady called me a liar and hung up on me; so I went back to the restaurant. When I pulled up to the window the lady at the register was very nice but the person in charge (a darker skin lady with very long blonde braided extensions who I assume was who I spoke to on the phone) came over to the window continuing to call me a liar and tell me she was not giving me my money back because she does not believe it was something foreign. My party of 4 all viewed the eyelash and were disgusted by the realization of what it was. She was VERY rude and I am honestly so disgusted with her attitude and lack of professionalism. I politely requested a refund and did not deserve the treatment I was given.",-0.9692
"How can you ruin a taco and burrito? Ask Fuzzy's Taco Shop because they have the recipe. It was incredibly disappointing food. We ordered the tempura fish tacos and burrito and I would describe them as edible. There was absolutely no flavor and I'm not sure whoever came up with the recipes had ever tasted Mexican food at all. 

There are some good reviews and I'm assuming these people took part in their bar because that's the only way I would be able to eat this food again.",-0.8337
"Looked forward to our lunch today and what a complete DISAPPOINTMENT!!! 
First, I ordered the Chilaquiles and when they arrived it was mushy and extremely acidic as if vinegar was used. . When I mentioned it to our waiter  he said what else do you want. I said just a carne asada taco. He came back in 5 minutes with a plate of 3. First bite, RAW MEAT! Raw! The waiter came back and I showed it to him and he shrugged and said ok.  He then made a comment that he already took my food off the bill anyway??? Huh? I. Asked to speak to the manager and he handled it horribly. He said the chillaquilles   were suppose to be soupy and that's how they make it in S. Mexico.   I eat this dish, everywhere in the US and out. Yes, Mexico too. when I spoke about the raw meat he said that's the way we make our steaks here medium well. I said do you think this meat is medium well. The outside was grayish in color. Horrible food and service. We will not return.",-0.7691
"Went to this location because the St. Pete store is excellent. That being said, I will never waste my time with this location again. The cashier was rude when I asked for a simple request, one that the st pete location had no problem fulfilling. When the manager came along, she was clearly annoyed with the employee but did nothing to try and keep our business. Very disappointing experience, don't waste your time/money with this place.",-0.4811
"The service here is great, but the food is beyond bad. For 10 bucks I got a coke, a handful of chips, and a soggy bowl of tasteless chicken and watery sour cream. No seasoning, no salt, not even fresh. I'm literally sitting here eating and contemplating my life choices because of how bad it it. 

Take the risk and just go to Chipotle.",-0.9561
"Where do I start. The service was awful we had to ask for someone else walking by to get our server several times. I specifically asked if they had ANY specials and he told me all the drink ones but forgot it was Taco Tuesday and I ended up paying three times what I would have for some tacos that where not that great at all. And to top it off after a very poor experience they automatically added an 18% tip. I wish I could give them 0 stars.  They did give us each a free taco meal coupon up to $10 when most of there meals are over $10 but I don't even want to go back.",-0.2877
"I'd never come back to this location again after the experience I had last weekend. There was a power outage that occurred just before I brought my boyfriend and two friends (who were visiting from out of state) to Tijuana Flats for their very FIRST experience. We completely understood and were friendly to the manager who immediately said 'I'm sorry but it'll be at least 20 minutes before food is available again.' As we took a seat, I looked at him and said, 'No problem, just let us know when you guys are ready for us!' And he confirmed that was fine. We sat for at least 30 minutes and no one came over to check on us. (We were around the corner and couldn't see the cashier stand full of people who had just been able to order ahead of us. We also thought the people coming in maybe took a seat too, or were picking up previous Uber orders) 

Finally, a girl looked over and said 'You guys know that you can order whenever you want, right?' At this point I'm hangry and not wanting to cause stress for this young lady... so I just hold my tongue while we walk back up and look at the same manager who very obviously neglected us. We wait another 5 min to order since a couple more people got in front of us... and the manager had the nerve to say again, 'Please be patient guys... we will get to you as soon as we can. I apologize again for these system issues.' I responded with 'We are just waiting like we were asked.'  At this point, he can tell he's upset me.

Then the food arrived with no appetizer beforehand, and again the manager blames the outage and his system issues.

Pretty sad when the most incompetent worker is the one who holds a title of management. Despicable.",-0.9562
"I had one of the worst times at a restaurant ever when my husband and I came here!! We were seated outside, as requested, and we sat for 20 minutes without even being greeted. So, we decided to sit at the bar to order our food. The bartender also ignored us for a bit. The food.... was awful!!! I had a regular taco with ground beef. The meat tasted old and dry. my husband got a burrito and he said the same about his. Definitely will NOT be going back here!!!!",-0.8652

It seems like it would be a simple transaction but there's always an issue. Your hours are terrible. Hooters, Precinct Pizza, and the other Channelside restaurants are packed for lunch every day.  I was excited to have something different for lunch today but you can't handle your entire menu on an event day? Also, the prices are outrageous for two tacos. I guess it will be Hooters again for me.",-0.5708
"20 min (no joke) for a chalupa & taco with just meat and cheese...quite possibly the worst, slowest T-Bell crew in town....management should consider replacing the cashier, and at least half the kitchen staff working@ 4:30 on 3/19/19....the remodel only polished the outside

"Went in to have a family dinner spent $70 for the waiter to completely ignore us with 2 kids. Had to go to the bar and ask for napkins and ask another server for more chips and a refill. My quesadilla was cold. We got fried ice cream that was ice cream in a taco shell when we asked why the ice cream wasn't fried the waiter stared to argue with us saying we were wrong. While leaving I asked hostess to speak with the manager he had his foot kicked back up against the wall with his arms crossed saying the waiter did nothing wrong didn't offer to try and fix anything and said it wasn't a problem. We will never be back east of $70 the salsa isn't even good. Very disappointed will never go back. The owner can careless is you are disappointed",-0.9629
"We arrived at San Jose Mexican Restaurant around 6:15pm. We joined my sister who was waiting at a table for us. It took about 10 minutes to be greeted and place drink orders with our waitress. Another 10 minutes later, when the waitress came back with drinks, we placed the order. Our waitress, Melisa, kept repeating back the wrong order and we'd have to correct her, she didn't seem very knowledgeable about the menu. I ordered a side of pico de gallo and she kept asking me if that was the one with avocado. And while she was in the middle of taking our order, she walked away to join her co-workers in a birthday song. I thought that was very unprofessional and rude. Then another 10 minutes passed and she hadn't put the order in yet. She came up to me again and asked if pico de gallo was the one with avocado in it. Food was entered at 6:51pm. When the food finally came out, the waitress and manager had the order all wrong. They were slamming the plates in front of us. They had to go back to the kitchen twice to get the rest of our corrected orders.
At one point, my 7-year old nephew found a small sharp bone fragment in his soft chicken taco. The ""manager/server"" on duty told us that when they cook and take apart the chicken, 'sometimes they don't get all the bones.' I'm sorry, what?! The manager didn't even apologize or show any signs of empathy. I am shocked that the ""manager/server"" actually argued with us at the table over an error that was clearly theirs. My nephew was hungry but too scared to eat the rest of his food. Melisa brought the check and was understandably embarrassed by how badly she butchered our experience. This was by far the worst experience I've ever had in a restaurant. They didn't take any responsibility for their mistake and I am dumbfounded as to how their business is still open. I would hate to see this happen to anyone else.",-0.9897
"Managers reply below is not even what they told me in person for reason I waited 30 minutes for an order of tacos after returning the first watery mess. I said no onions and peppers and they said that was the reason now it's they delivered to wrong table. Also please bring customers fresh churros or just don't. My stomach hurt from those oily hard things or the shrimp not sure. Also every other review is saying same thing so as on top of this as you are to reply I question your five star reviews in between them. We also waited for so long for water about 10 mins and if you didn't notice the other person I was with whose meal we did pay for also thought food was not good so he gave it to waitress half eaten 30 minutes before I said just give me a check and then you brought tacos to go I didn't even want at that point also rice n beans were also not eaten as rice was dry and beans were just like out of a can bland. I was not going to leave a review but had a feeling the way they tried too little too late others had same problem. Must be a new cook but more than likely it's bad management. I yelp out and typically have mainly good food when it has this rating. My problem were similar to other recent reviews. Stuff tasted foul... shrimp had off taste and meat tasted gamely and sauce was like water ...sent back n the half hour later said check since I was still waiting on 3 tacos which I ordered so it was easier for everyone. 30 mins for 3 tacos that were 3 ingredients .. they gave me free old churros and 2 worth a penny mini worry dolls which was just odd as it just came off cheap. The place was also dead so no reason for all of this but bad management.",-0.9716
"HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!  Went this past week and 4 of our orders had to be remade because they were incorrect.   Bar drinks were incorrect but we drank them because they were cheaper.   Waters and sodas were never refilled.   When we spoke to the manager he said it was due to Covid and they were understaffed.... we jokingly said ""well, due to Covid I'm broke and can't pay"".  He then told our party to ""get the fuck out then and don't come back"".  The bus girl started pulling the plates out from in front of me and almost got slapped by me because food was going everywhere!   JUST RUDE!!!!    We WILL NOT be back!!!!   He acted very inappropriately (we had children present) and maybe if they were so understaffed HE could've been helping more!  I'm in the restaurant business and will be spreading the word about this HORRIBLY RAN restaurant!!   Mistakes could've been avoided.... we asked for no onions... how hard is that???  The cheese was not melted on the quesadillas..... the meat on the taco salad was STONE COLD!!!.... and.... service was terrible as well.

When we got home, food was wrong... we ordered chips and queso with beef and had NO beef in it, even though we paid for it!!!! And my tacos had no tomatoes on it even though I asked for extra tomatoes.

They had the flat top grill off way before closing time and were using the tortilla warmer press to do the quesadillas and they came soggy and not good. The lady at the cashier was extremely rude and didn't even smile. We asked for water cups and only got one even though she knew we were a couple. Asked her for a fork cause they ran out in the outside bin and she was rude about it too and ended up just throwing a bunch in the bin and didn't even hand me one or say anything. Constantly with attitude and bad faces. The paint on the walls is coming off in some areas of the restaurant, some booth seats have big tears and holes in them.

"Just left and experienced the most cold, rude cashier I've ever experienced in my life. I felt like I was a burden to being there - as someone who had never been there before I didn't have a lot of knowledge about menu options. It was clearly an annoyance to go over menu items like enchilada toppings, bean choices and shrimp options.
Regarding food, The refried  beans were dried out and crunchy on top, which is a clear sign they are not being stirred or are old. The red enchilada sauce was ok. For some reason, the corn in my rice was very hard and chewy - assuming was previously frozen and undercooked. And my shrimp tacos came out not warm at all, so hoping that is not something I have to worry about later... the quality of food for me is an issue, but I would never want another interaction with that cashier again more than anything. The bad attitude was like something from high school..",-0.1885

It was terrible, had my husband try it as well, bc he does not have as picky of a palate as I have.. he agreed. It was inedible! My husband got a steak torta with more fat than meat in the steak! The only edible thing was our chips and queso. I would definitely not recommend this place.. I have no idea how they have 4.5 stars, which of course is what convinced my husband to choose this place. We were sadly disappointed! Spent $30 on a subpar meal that neither of us could eat. Left and went somewhere else! To top it all off my husband used the bathroom before we left and there was a large roach running around. Never will I ever go here again and will not recommend to anyone I know.",-0.7571

I order my kid tenders those were the driest tender my daughter has ever had you needed a glass of water to be able to swallow them down.

If you constantly want your order wrong and enjoy being treated rudely, or like to be insulted as a customer this is the place to go.

If you like people with filthy hands handing your food you are also in luck.

Save yourself the aggravation and drive to the next closest Taco Bell.",-0.508
"I'm very disappointed. I just ordered a burrito bowl through Uber Eats. I have a very bad reaction to gluten and dairy and noted this on the notes TWICE. I ordered a guacamole sauce as well instead of the sour cream sauces. I received a bowl with cheddar jack cheese AND the sour cream sauce. How do I know there isn't gluten in here also? You obviously don't read requests as all other restaurants do. Also, I have about 2 pieces of steak and the rest chicken and almost half is cabbage (underneath). Barely any beans either. Very very unhappy.",-0.8576
"This place was terrible in every way possible. We waited 1 1/2 hours for our food and the waitress was worthless.  Don't waist your time or money.

"Heed this warning or you will soon shut down:

Your tex-mex and hard taco shells are not fresh, toast them too, they were cold and stale, gross.

Cut the chicken pieces smaller, when I bite into my taco and pull out a piece of chicken, I don't want to have a dark empty cave where my food used to be, I want more chicken to balance out my next bite.

If I order a ""bowl"" or tortilla-less burrito it is because I want to cut down on my carbohydrates, why then would you serve me a bowl full of rice with only traces of beans in it?!?!?

The salsas are the only thing I have to add zest to my meal, please put out larger cups as I can't hold 5 cups in one trip (thanks though for making the small ladles equal to one small cup)

Make sure your associates say SOMETHING when they deliver and serve food to tables. I watched a construction worker from next door get his lunch thrown in front of him as if he were a dog.

Consider infusing your rice with fresh lime juice or using your plain salsa in your meals instead of simple tomatoes. I'm not into spicy stuff but if I were I would be disappointed with some of the salsa you put out, plus everything is a bit bland without it.

Look to see what people aren't eating after they leave. I couldn't believe what I saw! I ate everything of course because I don't waste food but it just pissed me off even more- I love tacos but not like this.

WHY?...... the only reason I came in was because there was no parking at Chipotle down the street. You think you have a nice location now but after all these other restaurants open nearby the customers you burned will just go there instead. I won't be back. Good luck!",-0.8577

"Brought five people in tonight,,,5 for 5 disappointed in the food. Service was very nice , the atmosphere is also nice but the food was really really bad. Dry flavorless on all accounts except the tortilla chips. Crispy chicken tacos... Rename to lame and dry tacos. Carne asada. Not dry but very small and flavorless and the tortilla was straight out of a bag... And not warm or cooked.   Very expensive as well. Go to Flemings for that price!   Too much time spent on being trendy and none spent on taste.",-0.7319
"Today I ordered on Uber eats  an el jefe burrito for my fiancée with no onions because he is allergic, 2 beef empanadas and my torta as a meal. I received one empanada that was CHICKEN. And he got onions and pico on his burrito. So I called and the employee wanted to argue and say he didn't see it and he didn't know but didn't even want to offer to remake it. I took it all to the store and had my fiancée go in. The employee told him they won't remake it, offer credit or refund even though almost the whole order was incorrect and I didn't receive my full order. I am disgusted better yet he threw a phone towards my boyfriend and was disgustingly rude. We love taco bus and go to the one in 54 and down off Hillsborough with no issues. I am officially turned off from taco bus.",-0.7865
"We left so upset. 

My mom and I waited 20 minutes for NOTHING! 
We were excited to eat tacos, came to this food truck, and yes when I saw that it wasn't the normal women that were working I should've just went with my gut and left. Instead there was two teenagers. The male working the register was not paying attention. It was as if he was nervous or something. I repeated my order twice and he read it back to me. I order 8 steak flour tacos. We waited, and waited..., when we finally were called, something told me check and sure enough....I was appalled to NOT only see the wrong food in my boxes, but food Im allergic to. SHRIMP TACOS!!! I got my money back and left. I AM CURRENTLY STARVING, driving to another place to get tacos. Didn't know it was this difficult. I see why they need a new cashier. 
To the owner: if you need real help, let me know. I'm bilingual and have food exp. This crap definitely won't happen while I'm taking orders. 
Im sorry for this review, but it the truth, and I'm so mad. 
I'll come back another day Bc I truly 
 like the flavor and convenience.",-0.8946

Not only was it cold but my steak combination had less than an ounce of steak it was all fillers (peppers onions and some potato looking thing) not only was the steak meal not good but my husband found a HAIR a long black hair in his 3 steak tacos. It was honestly disgusting because it wasn't just on top it was mixed in to the steak inside mix. Never plan on going back.",-0.4848

I would give them 0 Stars if possible.  I called in an order and they said it would be 40 minutes.  My husband went to pick it up and multiple people asked for his name.  He waited 40 additional minutes and the food was on the counter the whole time. They were rude when my husband questioned the COVID fee.   The owner told him to take it or leave it.  Well my husband left it. 

By the way our friend was with us and he was picking up his order too.  They tried to charge him COVID  fee and he complained and tried to say that they told his wife over the phone, which they didn't.   

We will never go there again.",-0.25
"If you know what real Mexican food tastes like do not go here. The chips and salsa were decent so I thought OK it should be OK. I ordered cheese enchiladas rice and beans. One enchilada with mole sause and one with Ranchero sauce. The ranchers saose taste like pizza sauce and not. Good pizza sauce at that. The mole I can't even discribe it. It was so bad I could not eat it. The beans were black not refried the rice well not sure what that was it had pumpkin seads in it no flavor at all. The waitress was nice but when we told her the food was not good she said sorry gave us a couple three mini churos that actually did taste Mexican. She told. Us the price was 10.99 for the meal when will. Came it was 14.00 over all one of the worst places I've eaten and I have traveled all over the US.",-0.8214

All the surfaces were dirty and sticky, from the tabletops to the drink station to the salsa counter. Everything had dirty smudge prints all over it. And we arrived there about 30 minutes after they opened, so it definitely was from the day before...or longer! Boxes cluttered everywhere all over the restaurant. The bathrooms weren't very clean. Food was mediocre. Staff was mediocre and not very sanitary. One staff member kept blowing his nose by the drink station. Didn't say ""welcome to Moe's"" when we walked in, which I could care less about, but should have been a sign that there isn't a whole lot of pride taken at that establishment.

Last experience was bad from start to finish. Took over 20 mins to be acknowledged at table, waiter interrupted us telling him our order to have a random conversation with a line cook walking past the table, our meals were wrong, half our food didn't come. Additionally, our waiter who only had tables near us and tables which didn't appear to be very demanding finally revisited our table after the food was delivered told us we couldn't order a second beverage from the bar at bc it was closed.... at 9:30. But why would the bar close 30 minutes before the restaurant with no warning for guests? Sad sad experience.",-0.9842

Employees seemed like they didn't want to be there but I was able to look past that as I worked in the Sarasota Fuzzy's and can understand feeling that way after a long day. We waited a while for our food and once it came the rice was under cooked, the meats (specifically chicken and brisket) had no flavor, the tortillas were cold, and our chips were stale. I asked for extra Fuzzy dust on my chips and got next to none. Compared to the Sarasota location this Fuzzy's is trash.",-0.6558

"The only reason I gave this location 1 star is because the food is really good... WHEN THEY HAVE IT!! The last 4 times I have gone to this location they are always out of something. Today at the peak of dinner rush, they had no cilantro rice, no stock on beer, soda machine was broken and barely any ice. There were 3 very new employees preparing the food and when he messed up, he scooped the food with one hand and slapped it on another tortilla. It all looked like regurgitated food. And considering they make it in front of us - not a good look. Floors and tables were dirty, the floor was wet in some areas and all the while there were SIX employees/managers in the back room (which is visible) standing around like its not their job. I asked who the manager on duty was but no one know (or played dumb). I asked who the GM was and again, the new employees had no idea saying ""This is my first week. I'm not sure"". I used to love this location but they will no longer get my business. I will be sending a letter to corporate. They need to crack down and step up their game.",-0.2702

The taco steak had minimal seasoning, the chicken in chicken taco tasted boiled with ZERO seasoning, the avocado fries were good but needed salt, the veggie stuffed poblano was literally stuffed with just cream cheese and awful. Everything was awful. I will never go back. All of our dishes were also cold and upon letting the manager know how awful everything was, he just said sorry and walked off.

And I have never stepped foot in a chipotle because Moe's is by far superior. But I can't count how many times this valrico location has met me down. Countless online orders wrong and or its not ready at all. When me and my family go inside to eat the staff is not worried about getting paying customers through the line over talking about there frustrations over their place of employment. If this location doesn't it change its approach they might as well put a chipotle sign above the door where you can get served garbage with a side of guacamole.",-0.5549

"I wish I could leave 0 stars! Ordered Moe's through Uber Eats a short time ago. My wife entre was ordered with queso on the side. She is lactose intolerant and can't have any, but she asked for some on the side to have it available to share with rest of the family. The order arrived with queso drizzled all over it. I called to complain and request a replacement, but was treated rudely by the staff. They refused to offer any type of replacement solution, and just kept stating my only option was to contact Uber for a refund. The employee raised his voice at me on the phone, and became combative. No help from Moe's was given, and I had to seek a refund from Uber which took 48 hours. Uber was apologetic and helpful, but it didn't change the fact that my wife's dinner was ruined. Contacted Moe's corporate and filed a complaint. Was contacted by a higher up who initially seemed concerned. I didn't ask for a refund since Uber provided one already, I just asked for an apology. I didn't hear back for nearly two weeks, and only got a response when I sent an angry follow up. I will be making a different restaurant choice the next time I use Uber Eats.

"Food was meh. The chips are oddly seasoned (taste like they have Lawry's seasoning salt or something), but they're alright. Quesadilla was inconsistently filled. The rice was undercooked. The enchilada was pretty good. The California specialty taco wasn't good. The black beans aren't  worth mentioning. 
House margs were alright, I was pleasantly surprised they weren't too sweet. 
Wait for the food was a bit longer than expected. All said, I would have given them 2-3 stars (price was ok, atmosphere was fine). But... 

The Big Problem: we saw an employee place ice buckets on the floor, dump the ice into the soda machine, and then USE THE BOTTOM OF THE ICE BUCKET TO PUSH THE ICE AROUND. So, she fully rubbed the part of the bucket that touched the floor all over the ice. I... I've always heard gross things about ice buckets/ice contamination and I just pretend I don't know about it, but this was way worse that I'd ever seen/heard. Also, she later rolled up the floor mats in from of the soda machine, brushed her hands on her jeans, then just started bagging to go orders. I'm a confrontation coward (like, I will cry, and it will be ugly) so I didn't say anything in the moment (also I was slightly buzzed and in shock), but hindsight I really wish I would have called her out in the moment ().",-0.3137
"My husband and I came in for the first time for lunch. We ordered the jumbo frozen margarita x 2- ($24.00 each) one regular and 1 strawberry. 

Another server brought the drinks and we advised we ordered frozen drinks and was advised that they didn't have frozen margaritas. There was no ice in the drink whatsoever which we both thought was really odd. We both took a sip and the drinks tasted like sour juice so the drinks were sent back. 

The server was not apologetic whatsoever. I came here based on the good reviews online. I will never be back. The food was okay nothing special.
Horrible drinks and horrible service.",-0.103
"Never seen such lack of professionalism and total incompetence at simply answering the phone and taking a reservation.  In trying to book a table for 11 people I had to call three times and each time the phone must have rung 8-10 times.  After requesting a reservation with the first person I spoke with they couldn't even remember the number of people in the party or the time.  I had to repeat it multiple times.  I then called back to see if we could move to a private room which the first girl advised they offered via their catering team.  When I called back the person answers simply ""hello"".  Nothing to identify the business.  I had to ask to confirm I had called the correct establishment.  When I ask to speak to someone about booking a private room she is completely puzzled by my mind blowing question.  She puts me on hold, then transfers the call.  Next person picks up,  I have to repeat myself all over to this new person.  They too seem completely puzzled by my inquiry.  She says one moment and the next thing I have a dial tone as she hung up the phone.  I call back yet AGAIN and this time once again, the person answering doesn't identify themselves or the restaurant on the phone.  This time a man answer and I ask for a manager.  He indicated he was and couldn't have been ruder.  I advised I was trying to book a private room and asked if he could put me in touch with the catering team that I was advised had to handle this type of request.  He barked at me that he can't hear me and didn't understand what I was asking about.  I repeated myself only for him to sit there apparently confused like the rest of the staff.  He then started barking at me again.  I finally hung up.  Needless to say we'll be cancelling our reservation and will no longer be seeking a private room.  If they are this incompetent and rude when I'm trying to get in the place, what will it be like once were there?  I don't plan on finding out.

I've never left a 1 star review before because I don't like being mean but this was ridiculous I can be treated like crap for free.  I'm not going to pay for it.

"If I could give 0 stars I would. I was very disappointed with the service I received while there. the kid behind the counter was friendly but I asked if they could make me chorizo tacos and was told no. why not? you have chorizo and of course you have everything else needed. 

my girlfriend asked for a cheese quesadilla with refried beans. we again were told no. again I ask why not? you have cheese and you have refried beans. why not make a paying customers what they want? 

After that I wanted to leave but my girlfriend wanted to try it. so we did. BIG MISTAKE!!   My weekend plans got canceled because my throne required assistance being held to the floor.  

I've eaten alot of Mexican food made by me or someone else. I know reheated food when I eat it. I know the taste of Pico that was not stored at the correct temperature.  LAST TIME I EAT THERE!

I had chicken enchiladas, and they were AWFUL.  I believe the chicken was spoiled, or tainted in some way and there was thick layer of cheese over everything.  Yuck.  My waitress refused to even try to communicate in English.  Yuck again.",-0.4117
"Food was ok but the service HORRIBLE. The entrance is very confusing. There's no sign indicating where to walk in and the hostess stand is in the back of the restaurant. When we asked the hostess if we could sit at the bar she yawned and just nodded her head. In the hour and a half we were there we only saw our waitress 2 times and she spoke very broken English to the point of not being able to understand our order or answer any of our questions. The menu stated that they have a special tequila menu but we asked for it the waitress gave us a confused looked and said ""we don't have it."" We were never offered refills on water or any other drinks. Our bill was wrong And it took a long time for her to get back with the correct one. The prices are WAY too high for the service. We were so excited for a Mexican restaurant to open around here but we'll never be back.",-0.9451

When I told the manager, he took the napkin with the bug in it away and never came back.

My final straw was sitting at the bar for 10 minutes, only for the bartender to appear and start working through her service bar items for another 10 minutes. She did this right in front of me and not once said anything like 'I'll be right with you'. That was my last visit.",-0.4215

Then a couple minutes later, two tacos were brought out, but they weren't his. We told the waiter the correct ones and that we were still missing fries. He goes and cones back later and asked how the fish was suppose to be done. Finally, his tacos come, but no fries. We gave up then. We were planning on getting shaved ice after dinner, but skipped out. Definitely not organized. The tacos were good, but not worth the value.

"Seems dirty and dusty. Poor service, and no customer service skills. Horrible experience, no one in charge, no apology or compensation for waiting 1.5 hours for a table and nearly another hour for cold, unimpressive food. Almost walked out twice, but with hungry kids and so much time invested, kept thinking ""any minute now"" the food will come, the manager will apologize and we won't be brushed off by our server who apparently lost our order or forgot to turn it in. Watched dozens of people, including another large party seated right next to us, get seated, served and leave in the time we were there. Should've just gotten the kids in the car and hit the BK drive through. I hate to not support local, small business, but this place needs a complete over haul.

"Not as good as the Dale Mabry location. This low rating is based on the following key components. 

Food: Tried the two tacos (chicken/steak) with a side of rice & beans. El sombrero, and the chicken burrito. Wasn't impressed with any one of these dishes. Not to say they were horrible, just lacked the flavor that I come to expect when eating authentic Mexican food. 

Value: Overpriced for what you get. There are much better options in Tampa Bay (not so much in the westchase area). Was not feeling the vibe neither. Had to make the drive to Taco Son the very next day just to feel a sense of redemption. 

Service: our waitress didn't appear to know the menu very well. She even forgot to give me a pen to sign the check, just left it on the table and rushed off. Had to ask to borrow a pen from the bar. She may have been new at the job. Keep your expectations at bay if you choose to come here.",-0.5002

"It's unfortunate that the service is so bad, because the food is good.  We've been there 3 times and each time the service was poor.  Most recently, we waited 20 minutes at the register to even put our name on a list, with multiple employees walking by but not acknowledging anyone.  When we were finally seated, it was another 15 mins to just have our drink order taken.  

At that time, we did ask for some chips and salsa.  We never got them as the food came 5 minutes after we ordered it.  For the life of me I will never understand why restaurants serve you half of the pig and give you 2 tortillas with that.   The person who brought our food was not the person who took our order, and we were never checked on by our server during the entire meal, nor did we get any drink refills.

After waiting another 15 mins after we were done for someone to come by, we finally asked a busboy for a to go box.  10 minutes later the original waiter came and asked us how the food was.  I asked for more tortillas, and pico de gallo to go, as well as a tres leches cake.  The waiter proceeded to tell me that the cake doesn't come ""to go"" because it's in a glass and did I want to eat it there.  Who doesn't have all their menu items to go????

At that point I just requested he bring the tortillas and pico.  He finally brought me a box, and when I checked it, there was tortillas but no pico.  I gave up at that point and went up to pay.  At that point I noticed that I was charged $4 for the tortillas they gave me to go.  Whatever..,,,get me out of this place.

I waited 15 minutes, alone at the register while people ran around only worried about seating new customers.  There was no one even running the cash register.  Twice I told someone I needed to pay, but was essentially ignored.  Finally, the waiter who had brought my food came to the register and apologized for the wait, but that was it.

The carnitas were fantastic and the portion was enough for 3 people (except the 2 tortillas that come with the meal).  However, they weren't good enough for me to ever go back.  The staff is completely unorganized and I found out they had a brand new girl seating people on a busy Friday night....but she was also cleaning tables and getting drinks,  This place needs a business manager desperately.  For now I'll stick to Taco Bus.....a well oiled service machine.",-0.6194

"I have been waiting for this open for months and boy was I disappointed! Looks like a fast food place but with gourmet prices. The food was a bit slow & did not arrive at the same time. Chips and salsa are not free even for dine-in. I ordered the chicken quesadilla, because I figured it was a simple start to give a new place a try. It was. $9 and looked like something from Taco Bell. The chicken did not taste good and was in chunks nit shredded but chewy. It had no flavor; I sent it back. It was not worthy. It came with no sides. My guest ordered a pork taco, which appeared okay, but she said was just that: ""okay."" She also ordered a side of refried beans for $2 which came in a portion cup like a side of sauce would usually come to a table. Again, just blah, is the best she could rate it. (And with that small of a serving, she didn't offer to let me  try a bite.) I will not be back. Nothing appears Mexican, but rather more of the other Hispanic influences typical to the area. Overall: over anticipated, overpriced, and under satisfying.

It states exactly what comes with it in the menu... Asked her for water and never got my cup of water. I speak perfect Spanish and I have no idea what she was saying.

"UPDATE: I came back. Twice. And both times I had a horrible experience. When I initially wrote my review, it was solely based on the food, as I had ordered takeout. The next time I went, I waited at the front for literally 10 minutes and no one even greeted me. Mind you- the place was NOT busy at all. Guess they just didn't want my money.

The second time I went, they were pretty busy- but not packed. I noticed they had quite a few people waiting to be seated so I just decided to get takeout to avoid the wait. Bad idea. It took 45 minutes for me to get TAKEOUT. Mean while, others were being seated and already had their food. I did not get one apology from the staff or even ""here, have a seat at the bar while you wait"". I asked for one of the staff to check on our order, he just told me ""we're really busy"", walked away, and started talking with one of his coworkers. Finally, just as I was asking for a refund so I could go elsewhere, my food magically appears. I grab my bag and hightail it out of that disaster zone. 

And then... yes, AND THEN, I get home, open my bag, and the orders are messed up. No tortillas for the fajitas, I ordered (and paid for) two beef enchiladas, I got one... and it was chicken. 

Needless to say, I will never, ever set foot in this establishment again.",-0.9523

And that was the kicker.  I walked over to the soda machine, and lol and behold, they had Pepsi. Aaaarrrrggg!!!!!!   I'm a Coke no Pepsi gal.Talk about adding insult to injury.  So I got the unsweetened iced tea. Yuck! No flavor at all.

Why would we need a server..sitting at the bar...with a bartender...and 4 people in the entire place?! We order drinks with the bartender in the meantime. Anyway, the server brings us chips and salsa and takes our order. We dont get refills of chips and salsa that is gone within 5 minutes. We ordered the supreme burrito to split. Server never checked in after taking our order and before bringing the food out which took about 10-15 minutes. When the food got there it was completely COLD. This just tells me the server or anyone else for that matter, didnt take the time to check on the food...since it was SO busy in there. The bartender never checked up on us either even after 2 more people sat next to us and he was by the bar the entire time. Overall a terrible experience. Not coming back. I suggest going to the location off Dale Mabry..so much better.",-0.6582

Came with family and we asked for extra chips and salsa, but said if we wanted more, they would charge us for extra. Only good thing about this restaurant was the Agua Frescas.

No one came up to us to get seated and the waitress that sat us didn't communicate anything or say anything to us really and we basically had to figure out quickly what we wanted. No guacamole even though it was on their menu and website and the waitress couldn't even understand what fajitas were. Chips were over cooked and the salsa was bland and too spicy. I got the chicken burrito and it was overwhelming with sour cream and it was lukewarm and the meat was cold. We got water and never was checked on for a refill. You know it's bad when you see a customer eating the ice and you don't do anything.

Our neighborhood Mexican joint was busy but INCREDIBLY disappointing. 

First off, it took forever to get a server to take our drink order. Second off the smidgen of salsa they served with the chips lasted for roughly 5.7 chips...pathetic. 

After she took our dinner order, she never came back to refill our drinks. I ended up walking up to the bar to get a Diet Coke refill. 

My husband ordered some grilled chicken dish...meh. The pictures in the menu look way better than the actual food we were served. 

I ordered the you pick 3 combo platter-ground beef taco, cheese enchilada and a salsa verde chicken enchilada. Fast forward to the delivery of my meal and she serves me 2 platters. You heard me right TWO!  One was my plate with a taco and cheese taco and the other was an entire second entree of their salsa verde enchilada. She was completely lost when I pointed out I ordered the you pick 3 combo platter. 

After mediocre food and a horrible experience we asked for the check...yep. You guessed correctly, she charged me for 3 entrees, not 2.

We stood around for 5 mins or so deciding what we wanted to eat and finally decided, placed our order and when we went to swipe our card and it didn't go through, he said he forgot to mention the card machine was done. There should have been a sign or the girls that greeted us at the door should have mentioned. But again, the place was filthy and smelly. Big time. Glad we didn't end up eating there. A dump.",-0.0953

"Wish I read the reviews first. Stumbled on this place because the food truck I was going to, their scanner was out of order..... so..... In any case, they recommended the taco salad. I was starving and I love taco salad, so I was ready. I grabbed my bag and headed home. Got home, got in my house cloths, getting ready to get in front of the television and enjoy what awaited. I opened the container and started forking through the ""taco"" salad and........... looked in astonishment- what the hell is this? All it was was iceberg lettuce, salad toppings, and sprinkles of ground beef. Tasted NOTHING like a taco. Even tried to gather some of the meat together to taste, and NO seasoning in the meat. If that's the same meat they Use for their tacos, then their tacos probably taste like shit. My goodness, I was so disappointed- I just put the salad in the fridge and ate some cereal. DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE. It's crap. Not even a one star. How is this place still open?",-0.6309
"Use to live this place. Last 6 times the wait is ridiculous add in I have seen people they seem to know we'll get their food way faster than everyone else plus they throw in a ton of salsas but won't give anyone else more than one per order. They messed up my order this time...just unacceptable better places to go without waiting 30 min to a hour for bad service. I'm done with them.",-0.8674
"Food was good, best guacamole, but service so poor we won't be back. I am only rating the service. Our waitress was incompetent.  She didn't know her beers, didn't have two beers listed on menu, she said she was vegan and couldn't recommend anything on menu, we had to flag down other waiters to get drinks, our entrees came when we were half way through our apps, didn't take away dirty plates, just a mess all the way around. Too bad, because the ambiance, location and food is all good.",-0.8955
"The ambiance was nice, the staff was great and the food was terrific but my visit to the men's room destroyed the whole experience.  It was one of the dirtiest and unsanitary restrooms I've seen in an eatery in some time. The notion that the staff are using it and then returning to the kitchen makes me cringe at the thought of what the kitchen looks like!

"Jimmy Hulas is ok, nothing worth coming back for.  Being that in the restaurant description it says Hawaiian, I thought I'd give it a try.

I am a vegetarian. Salty bean burrito and salty cheese enchilada. Even the veggies were extremely salty. If I can give 0 I would. I wasted about $23.50",-0.9319

Drinks tasted funky, waitress spoke to my table like we were children, tried to take our dinner orders before offering drink orders, food came out before drinks did, she split our bill incorrectly and criticized us for 30+ minutes that we were trying to not pay for something. The list goes on. No, I'm never going there again.",-0.8258
"This location is absolutely awful! They NEVER get the order correct. Anytime I ask for no lettuce no tomato it's always on the tacos. Nachos are either completely soggy or the chips are all crumbled up. Chalupa shells are burnt most of the time. They must have some of the dumbest people working there. And if it's none of this, then they forget to put items in the bag. I can't tell you how many times I have left with chips but no nacho cheese.

I witnessed a bunch of people placing orders after me and receiving their food before me. When I asked about the hold up they gave me the excuse of ""phone in orders "" which was complete bullshit because again, most of the people ordering were placing in person orders and receiving their food right after. Even when I got my order they failed to put jalapeños on my burrito. When I went back to tell them they messed up my order the lady working the grill had the Nerve to argue with me telling me that she did put jalapeños on my burrito. Even when I gave her back both burritos to prove there were no jalapeños(which there weren't) she didn't even apologize. Then the woman who works the register had the never to try and tell me to calm down as if I was in the wrong for being upset and acting on my emotions. I'll never come back here again.",-0.9577

Hours ago

"Atmosphere - UGH! Ok, granted, the place does have a lot to work with. It is a takeout restaurant that is one half of a very small, very old building. However, that is no excuse for the condition of the restaurant. It looked and felt dirty. 

Service - poor. There are 2 staff members. One takes the orders and payment and the other ""makes the food"". I ordered 2 soft tacos with sour cream. When I bit into the first taco I found that there was no sour cream. Nor was there any on the second taco. When I went back to the restaurant and informed them of the situation the person that prepared the food offered a weak apology along with some excuse as to how this might have happened. To their credit, they did offer to give me two new tacos. 

Food - Poor. Here is how they make the tacos. They have all of the ingredients (meat, cheese, etc) prepackaged  and placed into a soft tortilla that is then microwaved for a minute or so. The meat and shell was lukewarm and quickly became cold. The meat was bland. 

Overall - Never Again. To be honest, I would not return if the restaurant was giving the food away for free. 

Covid Practices - Poor. When I entered the restaurant (wearing a mask), both staff members were wearing a mask. However, neither wore protective gloves! While waiting for my food, a customer walked in without a mask and nothing was said to him. When I later returned with the incorrectly made tacos, neither staff member was wearing a mask. This place is tiny and this should never be the case",-0.7284

We went  here for lunch today and while waiting for our  main dish, my daughter needed to use the bathroom. I triEd the women's which was locked so I told her she needed to wait until it was her turn. No one ever left the bathroom so she went to use the  men's but the toilet was messed up in there. At this point my daughter was really  struggling so we went to ask about the bathroom situation and they knew the female bathroom was out of service but were unaware the men's was wasn't working. The front staff was really nice about it and told the manager.  The manager informed the waitress that the pump was broken and there was nothing they could do to help my daughter who was about urinate on herself.   My husband and I drove  there  separately so I left him at there with our son to get the Icies!  What really made me  angry  was when my husband got home he told me that the manager actually  fixed the toilet and didn't EVEN have the decency to tell us it was fixed! So my daughter was suffering unnecessarily. I mean she could have urinated all over  herself. That's really messed up he couldn't be courteous enough to help a child avoid embarrassment!",-0.9783

When the food got home; there was no onions, cilantro, or salsa inside the malformed tortilla they claimed to be a burrito. It was filled with 80% iceberg lettuce and the other 20% was mostly beans with 2 small pieces of meat.

The side salad was nasty too and mostly iceberg lettuce covered in watered down sour cream. Check the picture for proof.

My partner's burrito was also disgusting and plagued with the same problems 

Never come here, never let your friends come here, and never even look in the direction of this place... unless you enjoy unseasoned iceberg lettuce in place of actual food; in that case bon appetit.",-0.9464

Place is really really dirty and it took forever for us to get fish tacos. Place wasn't even that busy and we saw a family leave with most of their food not eaten on the table (should have been a sign) I had to ask for a to go box's because I needed to go, so I ate in the car on the way home.

I was the only customer. Even when we drove by the and looked inside..... no one was there ....This is not our first run in with horrible customer service at this location Taco Bell should really close down this location or bring in new management honestly just a terrible terrible location and the worst is that this is not a new thing I started noticing this location going down hill in like 2019 we use to stop by here on our way home from Busch Gardens but now we avoid it and then we forget and drop by the location to give them another chance and it is worse every time.

The manager on duty ""Austin"" was rude when my wife asked for the manager. He said they were short handed and hadn't had time to clean. 

Dining room had 5 people in it when we arrived and no big drive thru line either.

Best way to lose business is to argue back with a customer, we asked for the store number and he didn't know it, and a manager, please!

Ya me a pasado par de veces y no creo que voy a ordenar mas. Also their closing time is listed at 9:00pm it was 8:25pm and now all of a sudden they're closed.

"Another confusing idea by the Ciccio Restaurant Group. 

Is it a club? A restaurant? A sports bar? No one knows the concept of Luv Child, including the staff who told us it's ""Mexican & Cuban fusion meets 1970s diner."" The reality is as bad as the concept sounds.

Walk in and you'll quickly see the business model: appeal to college students who focus solely on the quantity of alcohol available. This is the place to go if you want margaritas by the pitcher and aren't bothered by hideous decoration, loud music, and poor quality. It's basically Denny's with music and a bar. Maybe serving food any line chef can make is part of the business model, too.

Still not clear what the vibe is really supposed to be, and although interesting to look at it was neither cosy nor classy. The whole place has an eclectic undecided feeling to it, echoed in the grub - useless to say anything about The Cuban except go elsewhere if you just want a good Cuban sandwich.

Sorry. I don't think this place is gonna make it. The college kids won't like the tab, and grownups won't grok the vibe. Anyone with good taste will be disappointed with the food. I am completely disinterested in returning here despite living nearby and frequenting neighborhood haunts.

But every single time he came to us, it was as if we had personally harmed him. The margaritas were bitter, fortunately we were able to get the service bartender to fix one, but when our appetizer was the tostones and they were soggy. So after that we were pretty much done.

Over this place and my time. And don't bother calling the manager ""Brandis"" as she explained rudely cause she could care less. Thumbs down all around.",-0.9631
"The food is so plain! No flavor at all, my husband wanted to bring in his own cumin and garlic seasonings. Can't believe they don't have plates for your food either!",-0.47
"This place gets no stars at all. Horrible, awful food. I cant believe they serve this crap & call it authentic, if this is indeed what mexicans are eating(& i know there not) this is why the cross the border for better food. Taco bus has waaaay better food, & there are better places to eat around the corner like jerk hut, moxies, Fresh and others. Worst $25.46 spent ever. I had 2 shrimp tacos w/special sauce and overfried beans & rice. It sucked badly. Go to taco bell if u really want to waste ur money but have sone taste. I shouldnt have to request a plethora of sauces to spice/season your crap up. WILL NEVER EAT THIS SWILL AGAIN, server was nice...only thing",-0.8918
"Without a doubt one of the worst managed restaurants in town. We should have walked out when we saw the state of the exterior (parking lot, landscaping, signage, etc). We sat at the bar during lunch and was waited on by the front door host. Everything in this place is dirty, nothing was organized. The bar sink had dirty dishes and water in it that had been there since last night or longer. We witnessed multiple employees using their cell phones to text an make calls while fixing food and drinks for customers among other things that just don't fly in a well run establishment. The food was below average, and they were out of beans?  How does a Mexican restaurant run out of beans???  The bathrooms were dirtier than a back roads truck stop off I-95, there was no soap at the since and no paper towels. Also missing was the required sign telling employees to wash hands, although they couldn't without soap and towels!  Overall a terrible experience, stay away",-0.9724
"Went to Taco Bell at 1:15 when they close at 3:00am. We waited in line for 15 minutes and no one answered the intercom nor did they answer at the window or the phone! How can a place state they are open until 3:00am and ignore everyone starting at 1:15. I am an overnight nurse trying to get food during my break! This is so upsetting! They get 0 stars in my eyes and I hope those workers tonight are spoken to by their manager!!!!",-0.7881
"The staff is a group of the most miserable people ever. It's unclear whether you seat yourself or you wait upon arrival. They should have a sign that says ""wait to be seated and if we get bored enough we may actually come acknowledge you and provide you a seat"". I've been twice in the last month just to make sure the first bad experience wasn't just a fluke. Nope. They actually seem annoyed you are there and ignore you waiting (one first actually asked me to move out of her way as I stood at the front door with other patrons looking for a hostess). Then upon being served the waitresses again seem genuinely upset you are there. Offered no suggestions and irritated by a simple request for chips. The food is subpar and the staff is just miserable. I'm never going back. Tried Casa Mexicana just a little further south on gandy and they will be getting my business moving forward.",-0.9725
"We have done drive-thru a couple of times in the last couple of weeks.  I hadn't eaten at Taco Bell in quite a while.  Not what I remember and.what used to be, at least at this location.  Everything was cold and chips soggy, nachos bellgrande.  Meximelt was nothing like I've had in the past.  And we only live a mile away.  Too bad.",-0.6818
"Terrible everything. Won't return ever again. Queso stuck to menus, wrong order, slowest possible service, half melted queso. Just disgusting.",-0.891

"This was possibly the worst ""Mexican"" food I've ever had.  My sweetie and I had the mocajete and the meats were horribly bland.  I was very disappointed by the whole experience.  The food is not worth the drive, even if it were free.",-0.7235
"It was St Patrick's day when I went to this restaurant. when I walked in it was small and also not in a very nice neighborhood. When we ordered the food we got it pretty quickly the food  was great but the reason I'm giving this restaurant 1 star is what happened when I got Home. I stayed up all night and threw up in pain agonizing pain. I also had explosive diarrhea. That night I did not sleep since the food poisoning was horrible. So a recommendation to everyone who is thinking of trying this place, if you want to throw up all your guts eat the food here",-0.966
"Worst service ever! We did not see the server after we gave our order, we had to asked the hostess for our bill!",-0.6892
"Food was sub-par compared to other restaurants in this chain that I've been too, cold and salty. But we were really disappointed in the terrible service! Our server was rushed and indifferent, she disappeared for long periods and seemed to be in a dispute with another server about tips. Unfortunately her sour mood put a damper on our lunch.",-0.9649
"I'm a huge fan of Chili restaurants and this one was a real disappointment.  I was having a casual business meeting.  We waited a short time for a table which wasn't bad,  but I didn't like the hostess wordlessly pointing for us to follow her.  Our server was nice (will not mention who) very perky not well trained or focused.   Two bar drinks were suppose to be put on a separate check, went ahead and paid them without a fuss.  The food was tasteless and my partners soup was served cold.  It didn't seem like the server was trained in anything other than dishing it out.  She got down to a child's (Gosh I hate that) level to take our order - I'm not a three year old so I couldn't make out if she had to go to the bathroom.  I'm very careful about my reviews and this is my first negative.  My work requires me to always give the benefit of the doubt.  Pity this was not a good dining experience.  
PT",-0.906
"Don't know what all the hype is about this place but had cravings last night and decided to give it a try. Had the ribeye and carnitas tacos. Yea the meat was tender but had no flavor... Very bland.. The green sauce and red sauce nothing to brag about. The onions were lil spicy but no flavor. The only taste in these tacos had was the cilantro. They add way too much cilantro.. Will be my last visit here..Overall if they were good tacos I wouldn't  mine paying the price but they are small and expensive",-0.1901
"OK, we went on a Saturday evening with relatively high hopes... I am sorry to tell you, our hopes were absolutely crushed, ground under the foot of terrible, slow service and worse food.

Our waiter was new, to the entire profession of waiting tables. He didn't know the menu, or really anything about what we were ordering. Yes, predictably, our order was delivered 30 minutes later, with the incorrect items.

The food itself, our burritos and tacos, had dry tasteless meat and nothing else remotely memorable. The salsa bar was tired, dirty, and generally disgusting. This was the worst freaking Mexican food I've ever had, and I've had some pretty bad stuff in the past. 

Interesting that everyone else loves the place. I'm sure it was the same place y'all went to. Whatever...",-0.8708
"Complete worst service ever. Consistently. I go back trying again and again as the food is decent for this girl from Texas who misses great Mexican food (their food is only marginal). The service is indisputably the worst in town. If you want to wait twenty minutes for a drink refill or ten minutes for a server to check on you, this is the place to go.",-0.6908
"I used to be a regular here. Until that time a person I was with got sick off the tacos. Was literally eating their taco and then had to excuse themself to the bathroom to throw it up. Gross

A week after that incident, we saw this place in Dirty Dining on ABC NEWS: http://www.abcactionnews.com/money/consumer/dirty-dining/dirty-dining-popular-downtown-tampa-mexican-restaurant-shut-down-for-22-hours-because-of-roaches 

Hopefully they've cleaned it up since then, but we haven't and will never return.",-0.4854
"Not impressed at all. My burrito bowl had hardly any rice in it. The rice that was in it was hard. The lady at the counter obviously didn't want to be there. It just tasted pretty bad. I would never return. The pico they use also has a very odd flavor.",-0.7243
"The place was dead, and so was the service.  We were sat right away, but then sat and sat.  Server disappeared and never came back.  After about 45 minutes of sitting there, we left, never having seen our order, nor an explanation.",-0.6124
"We were seated at a dirty table covered in old food and garbage. We would have asked to move but all the other tables were the same way. We sat for fifteen minutes and waited for someone to come over and take our drink orders, but no one ever did despite waiters standing around talking to each other. We walked out.",-0.5789
"Horrible food. Slimy chicken that seemed uncooked. My quesadilla unraveled and was filled with a minimal amount of cheese. Ultimately the quesadilla became wet and soggy. Would never return again!",-0.5848
"Been there a bunch of times since they opened and each time I noticed was not a good as the last.  This last visit was the one that made me say no reason to come back.  The food is usually ok but I really hate it when you can't get all your food at the same time.  My must have been sitting the longest as it was barely warm.  The service was mediocre and we had to wait a long time. We had to move tables as the servers kept bumping into us and carrying heavy trays over my daughters head..  Like I said the food was okay, just your average mexican so why put up with higher than average prices and lousy service",-0.753
"Horrible service. Waited 30 minutes to order. Service was nonexistent. They served half the table then waited another 15 minutes before the rest of the food arrived. Never again!",-0.5848
"Worst experience. Owner not happy that I brought discount certificate. Wouldn't recommend.",-0.8484
"Waited an hour for food. Service is terrible.   No chips, nothing.  Come here during the week the food  is good but it you can't handle the weekend. You need to hire more people or put less tables.  In the end the food comes and is missing the stuff I ordered.",-0.5423
"I can't believe they have a 2 star rating. Too bad you guys don't have a negative spectrum, like, 2 turds. That would be more fitting for this shit hole. I've seen better looking meals in my baby's diaper. And it was hotter in there than that one time i made a mistake of wearing wool underwear and going for a run. But my soiled and soaked underwear would've been a better meal than the slop they fed my family. Do they send workers to go through the garbage of shitty mexican food restaraunts in the area and then replate it? Are they a squatting restaraunt? That would explain no AC and dim lights. Are the owners of the plaza still fighting to get them out, but due to squatters laws they're allowed to stay until rightfully evicted? For shits sake someone arrest these people for the assault they commited on our taste buds. I won't be able to tell the difference between shit and french fries for at least a week! And our cloths smell like they sat in a over filled port-a-potty for a week under a hot sun.",-0.9796
"Not what I was expecting especially for the price, poor served tacos. Not coming back!",-0.5255

"Do not order online for delivery at this place through Eat24, they use a third party service Door Step Delivery. Charged my card 3 times took over an hour and 40 mins to deliver cold food with no utensils (granted at a hotel, so no utensils here) and missing any condiments",-0.5719
"STAY AWAY!! I went here last weekend and there was a big piece of fried paper mixed in with my side of fries! What's worse is the waitress didn't seem the least bit surprised when I told her about it and did nothing to offer to make up for it! 

No wonder this place was closed by the city for food care code violations and roaches in their kitchen! It's a shame they're allowed to reopen, clearly things aren't any better there. I'll NEVER be back here again.

Go to Miguel's on the corner of Kennedy and Macdill if you want good Mexican food.",-0.6569
"I will never come to this location ever again. I was here with my husband and a friend. For one there was a wait and we decided to take a seat at the bar and looked around to see a ton of empty tables, we were able to point out about 6 or 7 empty tables all able to hold up to 4 people. This is not adding in the dirty tables which there were about 4 or so and they were not cleaned for a long while. We finally get seated at the predetermined time (still don't know why we waited so long) then we wait for our waitress about a good 5 minutes. She finally comes out, we had enough time to know what we wanted already. We order and the food came soon enough, though we have no silverware. We alert our waitress and she says ok, but doesn't bring the silverware. To make it worse she still serves another table without getting us silverware. We alert another waitress we get silverware in moments. Our server, I won't say her name, was absolutely horrid. The manager, won't say his name, was even worse. The restaurant was dirty, garbage on the floor and the bathrooms need better upkeep. Why would a company that makes so much have such a disgusting dining room and bad service. I won't even get started on the person in the kitchen without a uniform on! Or the fact my chicken was inedible.  Worst experience I've ever had!",-0.9824
"Worst Taco Bell I've ever gone to. They take  forever and always get my order wrong. I would rather drive out of my way than come here.  If I could give them a 0 I would.... does anyone actually care about the sales here bc it seems like a bunch of high schoolers running the show.",-0.3612

"Potential Dirty Dining location

I went to the restroom while waiting on my food to come out. There was no hot water and hardly any soap so I'm not able to sterilize my hands properly. This is also the same bathroom the employees are using including the kitchen staff
I walked out and kindly said something to the hostess. She looked at me like she was crazy that I would bring this to her attention. Okay, so she's young and makes minimum wage....but she looks over to a manager that's sitting at the bar and he says nothing at all. He didn't care either

...Servers walk out while I'm eating at the bar and start rolling silverware. They place dirty bins on the silverware and then remove them and back to rolling again. This type of thing probably happens in the back room at most places but to do it in the middle of the restaurant doesn't sense. 
Guests health should be of more concern! I used to come here a lot, I won't be back",-0.4599
"This place was absolutely terrible. The waitress in the front was not welcoming and the tacos were extremely bland. I vomited immediately after eating, due to the food not being palatable. The sauce was extremely disappointing as it was flavorless. These were the worse tacos I've ever eaten and I probably won't eat tacos again. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! Sometimes you just have to pay for what you want, I guess in Texas the tacos are much more flavorful and the service is much better.",-0.8479
"Worst Mexican restaurant I have ever been too.  The chips were greasy and stale and the sauce tasted like it came right out of a jar.   The fish tacos were completely flavorles and small point but I have never been to a Mexican restaurant where the lemonade was so watered down.  I have no idea what attracts the lunchtime crowd.",-0.0129
"Dirty little place that doesn't care about customers health. They messed up my order with a another customer and even tho this person touched the food they  handled back to me like nothing happen.. I will report them to the health department.",-0.6628
"We were, until this moment, weekly customers at this place.  So when my parents came into town I decided to take our party of 5 out to eat.  Inside the restaurant, there was a Spanish speaking family, who appeared to be known to the staff, eating also.  Unfortunately, the children with that family were screaming at the top of their lungs repeatedly from the table.  I finally asked the family to quiet their children.  They refused.  The serving staff told the family, in Spanish, ""Whatever, I hear nothing and I see nothing.""  I asked for the check in Spanish, and we left without finishing our food.  Truly this place has such potential but the behavior they're willing to tolerate ruined the ambiance.  And we paid way too much for an evening out to have to endure that for the whole meal.",-0.6187
"My experience at this establishment is probably the worst I have ever had. We walked in and stood at the front door for about 5 minutes mind you it was not busy at all. The hostess which was so rude was running around like a headless chicken. We had to hunt her down to get us a table and she looked slightly inconvenienced. She threw the menus on the table and went back to whatever it was she was doing besides her job. There was one server who was doing his job he came and gave us chips and salsa. The server we actually had gave terrible service. We didn't get a refill ONCE. And she never  asked us how the food was. The food was terrible. The beans and rice were disgusting. I was given two tortillas for my fajitas. When I ran out of tortillas I had to hunt down a server to ask for more tortillas. The server came to the table twice, to give us our drinks and to give us the check. I don't know which was worse the food or the service. The only thing I can say was good was the margarita. It had a lot of tequila. I'm convinced that this place loads the drinks with alcohol so people get drunk and don't notice their subpar service and food.",-0.9454
"The food is not authentic. The meat taste like liquid smoke. The food has tons of seasoning but not a lot of flavor. Disappointed.",-0.5267
"Service was slow to bad the first time we went for dinner. It was terrible this time when we went back for lunch. We were the only table in the restaurant when we ordered on a Monday at lunch and it took over 40 minutes to get our food.  We had to have it boxed up because it took too long. A table of three Hispanic guys came in about 10 minutes after us and got waited on by the owner. They were done eating before we got our food. The food we finally got was just like the last time. Mediocre to less than good.  The first time we went it was 80 min for dinner with no one else in the restaurant. They have no idea what they are doing.  I hope the three guys they chose to serve before us come back a lot because we never will. We orderd steak tacos and chicken tacos. No way that should take more than 20 minutes.",-0.6344
"I'm sorry, I understand majority of America eats meat, but being a vegetarian and being a Mexican food lover... I find this place UNREAL. I have been to many Mexican taco joints around Tampa.. Mom and pop taco spots.. food trucks Mexican spots.. NONE of them have ever been so a NON Vegetarian friendly except this one!! The beans are watery as hell, and on TOP of all that they charged us the same amount as a plate with meat, but yet there was very little BEANS in our food literally a drop of beans. So I asked for a side of beans... and she charged us extra $2.30. YOU'RE KIDDING ME!! The lady was very rude at the cashier, Huffed and Puffed when asked for a plate to share our food, Huffed and Puffed when asked questions about vegetarian options.. just very rude. I'll take my money elsewhere who deserve my money.. who aren't cheap with the WATERY BEANS and don't charge for everything plus more when I'm not even eating the damn Pollo or Carne!! Horrible! I def rate them a 0 if that's my opinion.",-0.9659
"First of all this is not a Mexican grille.  Our experience here Can be summed up in one word - horrible!  Not only did they get the order wrong originally, they tried to charge us for their mistake  and the owner was very insulting.  Will not be back!!!",-0.9282

"12/7/11: Ordered food for pick up. I wanted no onions, no rice, and no peppers. And wanted to add cheese and avocado. We talked about in depth about the cheese because they wanted to know if I wanted it on the outside. I said no. I wanted inside. By the time I got back to my hotel to eat, there was no cheese and no avocado and there were huge peppers inside. It should have been called a pepper burrito instead of a steak one.",-0.836
"I have been coming here for 4 years and have always enjoyed the great food and excellent staff. I have even rented out the Señor Tequilas in 2013 for my sister's graduation from college. We were known by first name basis. This is how much we loved this place up until yesterday 6/26. We had the worse experience ever. Mostly with the service and management. Jesika C our server was awful. We waited 10 mins for her to approach us, another 10 mins on drinks with no chips or salsa. When she brought the margarita it wasn't even what we ordered and she rolled her eyes at us as when we told her they were  to be frozen. She flung the drinks down on the table and told us the machine was broken, and proceeded to leave. Awful awful - we could never find her or get her attention. Dinner took an hour and 45 mins because she was no where to be found. We would ask for drink refills and her response was "" he will get them ...I don't do that"" . Seriously!? I tried to ask for a manager and no one was to be found. I called and left a message for him today. Other parties were being OVER served - on the patio. Three men were highly intoxicated. So drunk that they couldn't even walk. Vomiting on the front of the patio. Carrying on and causing a scene. Where was the manager / owner to handle this and his staff? I asked for one and no one was there",-0.7969
"Food was great but I ordered an Horchata but our server said they were out so I ordered a Tamarind water 5 mins after the kitchen yells that the Horchata was ready. wasn't aware they were making more or that it would take a few mins if i waited a couple of mins. My significant other ordered a Jamaica (hibiscus water) which came out so sour and bitter that he only took a sip out of it so he asked if he can switch it to Tamarind water. Was never told that he would still have to pay for the jamaica water even if he didn't drink a quarter of it. When we go to pay the check we were charged for 3 drinks which were 2.50 each which is like 7 bucks right there. when we asked our server why we were charged for 3 drinks all she could say was ""you drank out of the other one"" which like i said we only took a sip of and when we let her know she replied ""i told him that, he still wanted me to charge you"" i don't know who he is? i'm assuming the manager? so he came out and we told him about being charged for the extra drink that we never even drank besides that sip and he continued to argue back with us saying that it's not his fault we didn't like it and the juice went to waste so he had to charge us. Now i've worked in the restaurant business for over 2 years and have been a supervisor and i was trained that the customers are always right. He expressed that anywhere we go would be like that which is not correct because i have never experienced that nor have i ever made someone experience that. When i let him know that it was ridiculous to charge customers for something they didn't enjoy and it would also make their business lose customers all he did was shrug his shoulders. I wouldn't recommend this place, the service was bad all around. Our server sat at the back of the restaurant on her phone more than 80% of the time and the ""manager"" well reading above tells you enough about him. Will NEVER return to this shitty excuse of a restaurant. Don't waste your money.",-0.9694

Smh... the lack of cleanliness and care for the customer is apparent. Me and my family will not be returning ever.",-0.0878

"This place is definitely gross.  I only gave it one star because you have to give it something to write a review for starters the restaurant was empty red flag number one. They gave us some lame excuse for salas and chips to start with.  while we sat there wanting service the waiter was goofing around and laughing with the cook not paying attention to us. I ordered the chicken tacos meal and a Margarita. The food had no flavor and was disgusting and the Margarita was pre made I saw the waiter pour it  from a pitcher. The drink definitely tasted like it was watered down. Needless to say I will never go back to this place again. Complete waste money.",-0.5267
"Terrible, will never eat here again.   The staff takes food that drops off plates onto the stainless steel work surface and sweeps that dirty food back into the serving containers.   Guess they did not get the message about sanitation.",-0.7184
"I went to this place again after my sister begged me to give it another shot. She claims it's great food. We walked in. There's about 5-6 tables all inside. Zero tables outside. They were all empty. I repeat: When we walked in all the tables were empty. 
In order to place an order you have to go up to the counter and place your order off the sign above the cashier. While we were placing our order a LARGE group of people came in and took every single table that was available. So when we turned around to have a seat after we placed our order, there was no place to sit. We canceled our order and left.

The owners of this place should NOT allow people who have not even ordered yet to steal every single table in the restaurant.

I am done with this place.",-0.5523
"Would you purchase this? The tostada and burrito had very limited amount of beans. Toppings and sauce on the tostada were everywhere. Tortilla on the burrito wasn't warmed up. Is this Taco Bell standards? This is what they learned in training? What would the CEO or Owner think of this? The food was nasty tonight and unacceptable.",-0.8902
"The food is just not good.  Service was also ridiculously slow, luckily we weren't seeing a movie we would have never made it.  We sat at the bar and had a margarita (tasty) and guacamole, queso, and salsa.  If a restaurant has Mexican in their name and can't even serve good salsa there's a problem.  I will say the greeter was very friendly.",-0.2776
"Quick Read: I'm not a picky eater by any stretch of the imagination, so it should speak volumes that I couldn't finish my meal.

We ordered a burrito, enchilada, chips, queso, and chicharrones for dinner. Having the opportunity to sample both authentic Mexican and fantastic Tex-Mex food, I cannot begin to describe how disappointed we were with our meals. An overpowering sourness tainted the majority of our food - while lime would be my first guess, this had a sort of artificial bitter aftertaste that rendered most of the food inedible. My enchilada was absolutely tiny; considering the price, I figured the portion would be a bit more appropriate. Even the queso was poorly flavored. Most other reviews seem to be mixed, but taking into account this restaurant's overall rating, I expected so much more. Miguelito's left us with a thinner wallet, bitter taste in our mouths, and stomach aches. We won't be returning.",-0.7605
"Horrible. I used to frequent years ago...food was very disappointing today. I ordered a combo plate. It was just dry ground beef with cheese. Guacamole was tasteless and blended to the consistency of baby food. I asked the waiter for his recommendation...the margarita or the sangria. His response? ""Well, you're the one drinking it,which one do you want?""",-0.8102
"Called in a togo order. When I got there thirty minutes later, they hadn't even started cooking it yet. When I finally got my salad (after another 20 minutes), it was soggy and missing half of the ingredients. 20 dollars for a corona and crappy salad.",-0.7003
"Absolutely one of the worst restaurants! Not only can they not get an order correct but the general manager as well as the manager have no manners at all! Being in the hospitality business I place  my customers first and they don't! I don't  understand why anybody would go to an establishment like this where people are not treated like family and a manger  won't take their time to make sure a customer is happy! It is extremely rare for me to write a negative report about a restaurant however I am extremely angry about the way I was treated!

Tasteless fish
Steak tacos had NO flavor. They lacked any spice of any kind. 

08-05-15 (same day). Just received this in response to my review: Josue G: ""Stephan G.? Whon send you? Are you the guy on The picture? You put one star in hole Restaurants????? You are The fake lie Haha"". 
So now not only do they purchase reviews from the Yelp hackers (look at the reviews; they all sound exactly alike as if done by scammers or a robot), but they also are illiterate and apparently don't speak English. LMAO.",-0.7856
"Used to be my favorite restaurant, I moved away and came back 6 months later and it has turned terrible for me. Chile Rellenos tasted old and excessively battered. Used to come here all the time, now I will never return.",-0.0258
"It looks like the owners gave up on this place. I was craving some Mexican food and I was just disappointed. Food was average, service needs training and it was hot inside and also dirty. I'm  certainly not coming back.",-0.2732
"This place was a mess. Walked in at 330 (Saturday) there was no one at the counter. Was dirty tables everywhere with stacked up food. They had one girl on staff who was running around and very nice. I saw coworkers sitting in the corner chatting and eating. Took 25 mins to just order. Poor girl. She's a hard worker. But this is the worst location I've been too. I've been here a few times. The owner sucks (I've never met him) but the three times I've been here been horrible. One time they were out of crunchy shells! How do you under order? Next time took 30 mins to get my food and the girls were rude and then this time. The owner doesn't know how to properly run a restaurant (which I used to be a manager of a restaurant chain). Sucks because I love the food here but the service will keep me from coming back.",-0.9633
"Very bad experience here. Wouldn't take my order over the phone. When I arrived, staff was disorganized and rude ... the person who seemed to be leading the charge was also rude (customer services starts at the top!). If you're in the mood for fast-ish mexican, go to Chipotle! Service is better, prices are lower.",-0.8974
"Sat there for a good while and no one came over. 
Don't get what is so difficult to come by after being seated. Just because you have good food doesn't mean anything if your service is bad.",-0.4838
"I ordered lunch for pick-up. Service was fast but the food was garbage. I'm sitting here in my office staring at a wilted salad. Literally, the lettuce is mostly brown. There seems to be zero quality control when it comes to their produce. I also had the California flatbread. That was also disgusting. They poured a ridiculous amount of ""garlic aioli"" on my flatbread. Mostly mayo, no flavor. Who puts mayo on a flatbread?  They also neglected to put avocado on my flatbread as well. Just poor food quality in general. Will not order again. I miss the Chili's that had a quality menu...",-0.9523
"They had burnt my quesadillas before and there's one guy that was full of sarcasm when filling the quesadilla. Today he was outright sarcastic - getting into a verbal exchange that went bad. I can attribute it to nothing other than a combination of discrimination/racism and the fact that I always order the vegetarian quesadilla. One instance does not make a trend. But two points are enough to draw a straight line. Not to say they don't have some sweet people working there. But overall its a racist establishment.",-0.8903
"Disgusting. The chicken was pulverized like it was from a can. The chips were so hard and almost inedible. Super disappointed. It was not tasty and not traditional.",-0.2455
"Went in with my daughter after school she was famished, long day, 6:01 ordered a Starburst frozen drink and a Quesadia...I was still waiting at 6:21 for a freakin Ques??? didn't even get the drink for her until I had to ask a few times where the food was?? The lady and her kid in the drive-through waited 20 mins and were complaining to the manager , it was so bad that they wanted a refund and left , I would have but my kid wanted her stuff she ordered. They need serious training and more staff to survive in this industry. Worst experience ever there or any ""fast-food"" place.",-0.9043
"Horrible service last night. Fajitas were meh. This location gives the rest of the Vallarta's family a bad rep!",-0.8221
"Went to this location last night and got two 7 layer burritos and the beans were hard, but the rice... not even cooked. I took a bite and a piece of rice CHIPPED MY FRONT TOOTH. I have never been so annoyed with a franchise in my life.",-0.6955
"One star is for the salsa that comes out with the chips and the house margarita that was really good. Everything else was a fail. I order the super burrito with Carnitas and when the plate arrived it looked amazing and huge. After 4 or 5 bites, I noticed I still hadn't gotten to the carnitas. I cut open the burrito and all I saw was rice, beans, lettuce and frozen veggies---yes, frozen veggies. Little green beans, shriveled peas and corn and carrot niblets. WTF?! really? And a teaspoon of carnitas at the end. I guess since we came at the last hour of business, they may have ran out of carnitas, or they are just scandalous like that. When I politely pulled my waiter aside to let him know, he sent another waiter out to explain that the meat is measured out in all of the meals. Ok, cool, I understand cost control but putting a teaspoon on meat on each end of my burrito is trickery to me.
They took the cost of the burrito of of our bill but no one apologized or tried to fix the meal. Out waiter seemed pretty apathetic, not that I expected a grand gesture or anything. They took 3/4 of my meal back to the kitchen and that was it. 
I will never eat here again. For the $13 that my burrito costs, I could have eaten some kick ass mexiCAN at Taco Bus and have leftovers for tomorrow.",-0.4712
"Worst restaurant in America. Not sure where to start. Took 2 seats at the bar in an average volume Saturday. 15 mins before the bartender actually showed up. Another 10 minutes for just chips and salsa. Insane. After the chips showed up from a different server - went almost 30 minutes after we sat at the bar to get our original drink order.   Food could have saved the horrific service  but was just average and took a considerable time to be delivered to the bar. AVOID this place at all costs.",-0.8373
"this place has been  getting  worse every  time  we go..  the first time there was no BEANS!!!!!  How can a Mexican  restaurant  run out off beans!!??  today  we waited a  few minutes to be seated because no one was there..  the place was empty..  we waited for someone to get drink offer but waited 10 min..  we even thought of leaving..  then they told us they ran out of cheese  and  chips..  when they brought food the beans were not cooked..  this place is getting worse..  we won't be back!!!",-0.6983
"Terrible Experience.....steak was undercooked and over seasoned, service was slow...would likely would not return",-0.4767
"I would give zero stars, got zero recognition for over 20 minutes. A Spanish couple came in after me and received service before I did. That's bullshit.",-0.5859
"I don't know why we eat here. There's no consistency, it's not clean, it's run by kids. I wonder if they wash their hands. Tonight the salsa was empty, the trash cans were overflowing, the air conditioning barely cooled the place. Over the last 5 years, sometimes we've had good meals and other times I've been grossed out so we don't return for a long time between visits. I think I'm finally calling it quits.",-0.4133
"WARNING: This is another incompetent Tampa Bay business. So...
YOU BETTER CALL AHEAD TO ASK IF THEY ARE OPEN.

I was really looking forward to this place based on the reviews. I checked the hours beforehand on their website and their Facebook page to make sure they were open Sundays and the hours were: open every day 10-10. 

We arrived 1/25/15 at 2 pm to a couple of men in the parking lot holding hoses and some of the furniture of the restaurant sitting on the patio. They seemed surprised and annoyed that we had driven in to the parking lot. We asked them if they were open and they said no. They said it in that way as if to say no, ""don't you see we are cleaning, of course we are not open.""

This place seems to be run by rude incompetent people. No signage at the restaurant explaining why they were closed, no messages on their social media page explaining they would be closed, nothing on the website, etc.

Perhaps it's time for Loli to re-take Small Business 101. I won't get into the nitty gritty of how to run a business, but suffice it to say Lolis has no clue.",-0.8674
"Horriable service only came to our table 2 times once to order food and once to bring the food. Never checked on us the food was super Hot and never came over to ask if we needed anything else. Perhaps some Water I will never go to this place again. The entire experience was bad if you are going to send your hard earn money. The experience is also what your paying for not just the food. Check on your customers. If your short handed then you as a manager. Should pick up the slack and move with a since of urgency. Waiting forever for the food and waiting again forever for the check. If I could give it 0 stars I would. Go someone where else!!!!",-0.2887
"We went there last Monday for lunch. Best salsa I ever had. The salsa had roasted peppers In it. Went there yesterday just for that. The dumb ass waiter didn't have a clue about the salsa. He offered to bring a bottle of hot sauce. HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED.",-0.8156
"Skip it, go down Fowler (east) for another Mile... to Qdoba's.

Ok, first off the good.
The Tortilla's are fresh, but they were a little under cooked.  Tasted good, but not great.  

ok, that's all the good I have to say.

My rule with a new Mexican place: Order the Queso.
I knew instantly that this was going to be bad.  Velveta / Rotel is not Queso.  Just flat out gross.

Steak Chimichanga's were pitiful.  Under fried, but the steak inside was so overcooked and flavorless, I was thoroughly disgusted.

The refried beans & rice were also foul.  

The worst of this experience was asking for Sour Cream.  They brought us a little solo cup of Warm ""Sour cream Sauce"" ($1.49) that was split, and overall tasted like a really bad Alfredo sauce.  I bet this was a powder + water situation, just gross.

The waitress was also laughable.
She asked me if I wanted to speak to the manager about removing my entree from the bill.  I told her, only if he needs to, but I'm not paying for it.

Look, Tampa... I'm new to Town.  Please tell me I'm just having bad luck.
I cannot find really good mexican (or anything for that matter) in Tampa.
What gives?

Someone please point me to some Really good places, that a Chef can go and guarantee to not be pissed off when he leaves.",-0.7821
"Not good. This is a downtown restaurant! (I know, what's that got to do with it, downtown rent) 
I had a tostada salad my guest had tacos with rice and beans. Flavorless! Not seasoned, bland and ordinary at best. 
Bathroom should have scared me away but we had already ordered. I see it as a lack of respect for people that work and or live downtown. 
I wanted this to be good but this is a place to skip.",-0.3707
"I'm a regular to several Chipotle's, and notice when they change the price. They recently increased the price of the meals I get, and when I questioned the price, the cashier got defensive and told me I was wrong. Then, after I paid and walked to a table, she continued to talk to the other employees about my question, like I was the issue. Really sloppy customer service. 

I went back and checked old receipts, and they increased the steak. No problem, just don't make me feel like I'm out of line.",-0.0258
"Pretty much the worst food I've ever had slopped on a plate. Bad, really really bad. The chips and salsa were completely bland. And although they have a children's menu, they didn't have milk as a beverage option. My daughter's quesadilla was the only thing that was hardly even palatable. The refried beans were awful. Not even edible, even with salt and salsa. The chile relleno was a pile of bland ground beef with melted cheese on top with one small piece of pepper hidden under the beef. And the taco was just as gross as the rest of the meal. I would most definitely recommend that you stay far far away from this restaurant.",-0.7703
"Ok my colleagues said it was great food. Ya NO. THe chicken taco was so dry the meat tasted as though it was 3 days old and I had to choke down a half a bottle of water due the dryness which was almost equal to chicken jerky. Wait it gets worse..... I also ordered a chicken burrito and it was the worst. Around a tablespoon of burnt chipotle chicken/95% runny refried beans with 2 tablespoons of yellow dry rice with a miserable left over cut up cabbage??lettuce?? I can honestly say I was not sure what it was it and who ever puts together the meats likes to reuse day old or 5 day old the chicken was burnt like it had been sitting in a heat tray for days. Will pass on this restaurant if they ever want to order again. Very heavy on hot spices which I think was to drown out the nasty quality.",-0.9033
"So we decided to give this place one more try after being disappointed last time we went. Well.... bad experience again. After waiting over an hour for our food, the server had the audacity of saying it was worth the wait. The food was not great and no it was not worth the wait. Then we asked for the check they took long even to do that. They got their second chance, not going back!",-0.6703
"Right off the bat, first time here, from Wisconsin, hostess/waiteress wanted nothing to do with our group of 4.....45minute wait, wouldn't take my name...what the heck?  We came in knowing it would be a wait, but the way we were greeted, definitely did not want our business...... HORRIBLE SERVICE, SKIP THIS PLACE, LOTS MORE OPTIONS THAN THIS PLACE",-0.2459
"I'm not at all impressed with the service here. Not sure why the attitudes are so poor, I do have a strong Feeling that it has to do with the manager. She seems to have a poor attitude every time I go there to get my guacamole. I think I will have to go somewhere else for my cravings!",-0.8398
"Just moved to the area and am looking for a good mexican place.  This was not it.  My waiter was overly attentive while I was looking at the menu trying to decide but once I orderd and the food came - forget it.  I had to flag him down to get another drink and more napkins.  I orderd the chicken chili cheese nachos - but they seem to have forgotten the chili.  I would not reccomend this place and I won't be back.",-0.4118
"Got a bowl that literally had enough stuff to fill a taco
Asked over and over again what you want and even after you tell them they ask again
Ran out of everything so waited forever 
Spent 20 bucks for the equivalent of a taco 
Worst Chipotle period 
And it's dirty to",-0.7717

"tterrible service. We waited 25 mn for our food.server never check on us, we had to get up and check to see about our order. All he said sorry cook very busy. They were not that busy. Nevrr sgain.",-0.0772
"Stopped by here cause I was in the mood for some Latin food and ordered some Tacos  and rice and beans . First of all THE SERVICE WAS  HORRIBLE . By the time I finally got my tacos I was disappointed to find my food COLD .to make matters worse the meat was bland and the rice was stale and looked burnedand tasted like cardboard.(to put it nicely) had high hopes as I love Latin food but ..needless to say ..I  won't be coming back here .",-0.2183
"Bad slow service.... food bad.... green sauce tasteless. Is this the same place that others rated so highly?",-0.5423
"Food was fantastic! We went in for lunch on taco Tuesday with a party of 8 because they have really good specials! BUT we waited 20 minutes for our drinks and we were completely ignored multiply times! The bus boy feeling sorry for us took our drink orders! I guess by this time the server ""gave up and let him have us"" so on top of his other duties he had a party to tend to! Add the fact that the poor guy barley understood English!! U can imagine how the lunch went! I like to add I am also a server so I am very understanding!! But the costumer service is ridiculous!! And I hope the poor bus boy finds a place of employment that doesn't treat him like crap",-0.3249
"Horrible place poor customer service, expensive food. First time that I visit this place, I will never come back. The A/C does not work. They charge you $1.00 per topping. I have  necer seen a taco place like this one. No Good Period.",-0.5267
"The service was bad my ice tea kept being empty the steak on the fajitas was very touch told waitress and acted like she didn't care won't be back for sure",-0.4815
"This location is definitely a consistent let-down. It sucks because it's the closest one to me so sometimes it's my only option. They're usually always out of something I want,they get my order wrong,or forget something. I see that they had a now hiring sign on the window, so maybe that's why they're never up-to-par. Hopefully it improves soon!",-0.1154
"This was the rudest staff I've encountered in Brandon.   I tried to order water, chips and sa..... and was immediate and sternly interrupted and then chastised for having the audacity to ask for chips and salsa and queso.  Then she touched my arm and appeared to be talking down to me as she explained that she was waiting two tables at the same time (mind you there's only THREE tables at the moment) and proceeds to talk shit about the new girl, as if that's why she was so busy with her two tables.   I had all I could do not to walk out after placing the initial appetizer order.   My food was cold and tasteless.   We waited 7 mins for the tortilla to our fajita - so now we have seasonless, lukewarm chicken, onions, and peppers.    We will never be coming here again, let alone leaving a tip.   (And we never stiff staff on their tips - we've been in their shoes and know what it's like.) this place is horrendous.",-0.9538
"The food was decent and the kitschy Chihuahua theme WOULD have won me over but then....I saw a German cockroach. I'm weird about that kind of thing so, no, I will not be eating there EVER again.",-0.5422
"I have never had such poor service, actually none at all. We sat there for 20 mins and did not get one server to come up to us. After asking the hostess multiple times if there was a server, there was one server that just kept staring at us and walking away. I couldn't help but notice that we were the only non Spanish people seated, which I do not mind, but I couldn't help but think that was the reason that we didn't get served was because of that. Mind you the place had maybe 5 tables so it was not busy. I was a server and that is unacceptable to not even greet a customer. After 30 mins of not even getting a drink order we left. I will never be returning again.",-0.8474
"I was looking for a yummy authentic Mexican food place in the area ,nothing but utter disappointment. Starting with the the staff .. the one women that served us one kept making mistakes which is understandable since we are all human but kept making food and drinks wrong and claimed she wouldn't charge us for it. Also Her manager had the most disgusting behavior towards us and her employees. Any request you would make she seemed like the worst thing you could have asked of her. Would get upset if you asked her any sort of question about the food or menu and often rolled her eyes. The food items were okay... nothing note worthy and I really wanted to like it since the place looks clean but a combination of bad food and bad attitudes from the wait staff just didn't do it for me.",-0.9694
"Their hours say they're open until 3am (today is Thursday going into Friday) and the current time is midnight. I get to the drive through and no one is responding. I say hello and then the cashier said that they were closed was chuckling. Why have an ""hours of operation"" if you're not abiding by them? A waste of time and a drive.",-0.3818
"First time here and was greeted with please take a seat anywhere. So I did and I can tell by our server's attitude my time here was not going to be comfortable. Service was horrible and by reading some of the reviews I'm not shocked. Salsa was watery and chips were stale. The food overall wasn't bad however our pissed off server made my time there very uncomfortable. I will not be returning nor recommending this place.",-0.0209
"This was the worst meal I have ever.  The manager, Jabari,  was rude and disrespectful.  My taco salad was swimming in fat and cold in the middle.  The owner, Alex, had to be chased down in the parking lot to correct the terrible service.  Stay away!!!",-0.9017
"This chipotle is actually the worst one I've been too! They skimp on EVERYTHING! I bought a bag of chips to eat with my meal and I shit you not there is like 10 chips total in there. I want my money back!",-0.8856
"I ordered tequila shots and without asking me gave me Patron and charged $9 per shot and was also charged for two extra drinks I hadn't ordered and when trying to get the issue resolved, they threatened to call the police! I will never visit this establishment again.",-0.636
"This was the worst experience, service wise, that I've ever had at any restaurant. Stephany was the most incompetent person I think I've ever met. She took 20 minutes too greet us, 10 minutes plus just to bring stale chips and tap water. When I ordered my food she placed it, food came up in the window and it sat there for another 15 minutes  getting cold. Finally the food arrives and mine was completely cold and disgusting. At this point I just wanted to leave. Instead of her saying any type of apology or at least being nice she drops off a check with just my girlfriends burrito. It then takes ANOTHER 10-12 minutes for her too come and grab my card. I then have to go walk and get my card since she thinks it more important to talk with her co-workers vs pay at least a little attention to a pissed customer. 
Stephany, do yourself a favor and find another job cause you're terrible at this one.",-0.8225
"1Food is delicious except when they mess up your order and you call it in to replace took about an hour... :-(",-0.0772
"They say they have vegetarian tacos but they do not. What you will get is a bean mixture so thin you cant taste it and a LOT of white rice.

When asked for more beans to compensate, she gave us a bowl of beans so thin and flavorless a spoon cant hold it up. 

After all that, 3 items ordered vegetarian with basically White RIce subbed for meat -- she charged us for the bowl of beans.",-0.296
"Reading these horrible reviews and being part of the service industry this is unacceptable! If you have food that is amazing with bad service, the food no longer matters. Get your priorities straight!",-0.7896
"This location used to be on top of their business. The last month has been abysmal. Just order on umber eats. No salsa, so guacamole or pico that was ordered. No plastic ware or napkins. Seems to be a trend. Just avoid this location and get chipotle across the street.",-0.5859
"I went there with a group of friends (well educated and successful men and women 30-55 y/o) for brunch. One of the party members got immediately sick with in 15-20 mins of eating and was diagnosed with Norovirus. (DISGUSTING!!!!) I also got horribly sick within 15-20 minutes of eating which lasted until the next day. This place is as dirty as it gets and is horribly managed. SHUT IT DOWN!!!",-0.8346
"Terrible service. My burrito bowl was barely filled. No cheese, and it was supposed to be mega-whatever. My wife got a simple trio and we had to tell them 3 times about her not getting it. Very disappointed. The location in the windixi shopping plaza on fowler is incredibly better.",-0.6395
"I went to this place solely based on the yelp review. The place was clean. The service was bad, and food mediocre. We will not be back.",-0.2023
"Horrible food. Very low key quality food. We order a Jalea, was made with the 4.99 bag of mixed seafood, super bad. The arroz con pollo, greased. 
The colombian chuleta, was greasy. 
Save your money and time",-0.3167
"Urban shitina. The service was so outrageously bad that I will never ever set foot in here again.  The dimwitted waitress charged someone else's bill onto my credit card. then said she couldn't reprint an updated receipt after it was supposedly ""corrected."" and said ""don't worry, it's taken care of."" When I received my statement and there was no ""Correction"" the restaurant was called. Multiple attempts to get a manager on the phone finally found me listening to some asshat saying he can't retroactively credit a card.  What kind of 1980s system are these people using!? So I was told a credit would be mailed to me. You think that happened? hell no. I look forward to hearing that this place has gone out of business- it's just a matter of time.",-0.6799
"Smallest burrito ever from a Chipotle!! Manager stated that they have been told to ""cut back"" to help costs.... seriously after all the issues they have been having!! Last visit here",-0.3111
"Don't bother. The food was actually tasty but the service was beyond bad.  First, they were short staffed. The server was clueless. I ordered Tostones and She asked me what that was because she's Mexican and they don't eat them. I also preset the Moros rice (mixed rice and beans) and asked her if it had meat and she said no. When I received my plate the rice had bacon in it.  My mom ordered fried pork pieces and was served beef stew. Overall a very disappointing meal. I won't be coming back.",-0.9434
"They have been out of almost everything now for the past 3 weeks. Nacho cheese(which comes on almost everything), BEEF, baja blast... the list goes on. Is no one making the orders for these items? Where's the management? Horrible location will never ever go back to this one.",-0.7236
"Why the hell would anyone vegan vegetarian  visit a joint where if you do not choose a protein which is included in price and instead choose grill vege they charge you $2 more.

WTF moment.  I refuse to indulge and ask for a refund when my qeusadilla with vege cost.more than the chicken or steak.

 Manager was good enough to oblige and charge the actual price withe

This kind of joint will.never last long.   I am hesitant now to ever visit Qdoba",-0.8998
"The food, service, and decor is horrible! I went in on a Friday night and it took them 15 minutes just to get my drink order. It wasn't even busy one waitress was standing around and the other was cleaning tables. Now I get it, trying to keep tidy, but 15 minutes is ridiculous.

 Then as an appetizer I ordered the queso fundido that came with chorizo.The cheese was supposed to be creamy and melty instead it was grainy which happens when you over cook the cheese. Next, I orderded the chimichanga for the entree which essentially its a burrito deep fried which is how they advertise it on the menu. When they presented it, it was NOT deep fried! It was toasted. 

Now as for the decor...it wasn't your cheesy Mexican decorations it was all about chihuahuas (the dog). They actually had pictures of Paris Hilton up.

In a nutshell, the restaurant was extremely overpriced and it was NOT AUTHENTIC!!! Honestly, Chipotle has more authentic food than this place and its cheaper too.",-0.8717
"Had bistec a caballo. The steak had no flavor and the white rice was horrible. The rice tasted old and had a weird texture. My husband had chicken with white rice and maduros and same thing with the rice. We end up eating less than half of our meal. Before leaving the place we heard a family on another table saying something about the taste of the rice and the waitress took the plate with her.  I would not come back again.",-0.7506
"Very disappointed that Chili's cannot handle the overflow from a Bucs game being they are right by the stadium.  They serve the drinks in a plastic cup and do not tell tell you the two for one is in the plastic cup.  I would think that Chili's would want uniformity in there locations.  The food was not hot either.  However, that was alright as we expected that from Chili's.",-0.2716

"I normally don't post reviews on yelp but this particular location is terrible!!! The person taking our order not only rushed us to place the order but also had a really poor attitude towards us. He didn't include the sauces we asked for and when we got home we noticed that all of our food was stale and old. The sour cream had an obvious expired taste and I didn't even eat the rest of my meal. What a complete waste of money!",-0.9393
"AVOID IT, AVOID IT, AVOID IT. If you don't want to get sick,  don't go there. My niece went there on Thursday night and had some ribs, soon after that ,she started feeling sick and has been sick the whole weekend. She was perfectly fine until she ate the food from this restaurant. If you don't want to be in your bathroom for 3 days o more, just DON'T GO THERE.",-0.9126
"Wanted to try something new and This place sucks. Complete rip off of chipotle (which is about 100 times better). No flavor, black beans were dried out, fajita veggies had a strange flavor. Only decent thing here was chips and queso, which was $4! I won't be back. Stick with Chipotle!",-0.7256
"I was wondering how could a Chipotle restaurant have 3 stars but just experienced the why. I placed an online order and I was 20mins late to pick it up and it wasn't even ready! They had absolutely no idea i had ordered anything but when they checked, somehow there it was, they printed out a receipt that only said Burrito so they had me stand in line and reorder everything! If I wanted to do all that I wouldn't have taken the time to order online! All I wanted to do was grab my food and get out. To top it off they overstuffed the Burrito (not with guacamole may i add cuz they skimped on that bad!) and she couldn't even wrap it right  so ill be eating a burrito bowl if anything! They didn't even apologize.",-0.905
"It was a really bad experience. We were there for 5 min waiting for service and nobody came. Actually a server walked by a few times and didn't say anything to us. We just left.",-0.5849
"Bad experience!! We placed our order and about 20 minutes went by and we still had not received our food. We asked them about and it turns out they didn't even place our order!! So then we had to wait even longer! Once we got our food it wasn't even good. And even then they got our order wrong and we had to reorder and pay for what we originally wanted. They need to work on organization and getting orders out in a timely maner!!",-0.8903
"We came in on Sunday night.  The place was empty with maybe 3 tables occupied.  We waited 7 minutes to be seated and were told we could sit outside on the patio.  We waited about 5 minutes and a server brought us chips and salsa.  We then waited 15 minutes without any service before I went to the check-in station. I waited there for 5 minutes as the host was writing something down.  He finally got to me and I told him we were outside waiting for our server on the patio.  He then proceeded to tell me the patio is closed.  I explained that another employee sat us there and brought us chips.  He said it was closed and if we wanted service then to move inside.  We did and another 10 minutes later guess what? No server.  We left.  This is not how you run a restaurant. We didn't feel welcome or wanted.  Won't be going here again for sure.",-0.4905

"Honestly the worst acai bowl I've ever had. I got the tropical bowl and the acai was almost a peach color and had the consistency of soup with a few bits of banana floating in it. When I got home after a few bites I almost threw it away and went to get a decent one somewhere else, but didn't want to have the almost $10 I spent on it go to completely to waste.",-0.7185
"Seriously....how is this location ALWAYS out of things....who does the ordering? Is no one held accountable? And it's not little stuff....they have been out of nachos, beef.....what I dont get is with how close restaurants are, why dont they borrow from neighbors and transfer cost. Also, my order tonight was shorted 2 nachos and the chips in the bellgrande were stale. This used to be well run 5 years ago but now it is just aweful. I will drive a little further to go to the one on the Causeway.",-0.1053
"Tried a 3time with family daughter and myself got good food. However wife became ill and was diagnosed at the hospital for food poisoning. They put it in writing, I took report to chapote they read it and then I saw the manager throw the report in the trash.  That's my last visit, I sent a copy to county health they said that's one of several they received during last 30 days and it was on schedule to be rei-inspection this week.",-0.5719

"I love Tijuana Flats. I lived next to the first location when Brian opened. Today I had a very sub par burrito here. The wrapper was wrong and so were fillings. Not busy so I don't know what the problem was. Unfortunately I was out of time. Server did offer to have it remade but I have limited time on lunch. I won't return here, but I will try other locations.",-0.5187
"What a horrible experience! Used to love this place but went a few nights ago and it has really gone down hill. The margaritas were returned to the bar (even though they were two for one, yuck. Not worth it!) The service was terrible, the food was less than mediocre (even the queso dip wasn't good) but the worst was that one of the waiters helped themselves to my brother's credit card numbers. First and only place he'd used the card since arriving and by the next day someone was trying to use his info around town. Called the manager of Varrata's and he was SO rude!! According to him none of his employees could have done it as apparently none of them would eat hamburgers or buy gas. (right...) What a terrible experience and the worst was I had brought out of town guests to this nightmare of a place. Never, never again. Go to the movies, skip the Mexican restaurant!!",-0.9809
"Let me just start by saying I never write reviews but felt I had to this time. My husband and I have eaten at this location a number of times since it is down the street from where we live.  The food is good for the price, fast (at times), and convenient. The workers have always been extremely pleasant until recently.  My husband and I went a week ago to order a few tacos to go. We got the usual--two beef hard tacos for me, no cheese. Two chicken tacos for him, cheese.  When we arrived the place had a few tables occupied. By no means was it busy.  We ordered our food and noticed that someone that entered way before us received her food almost immediately. Frustrated because at this point it had been over THIRTY minutes, my husband decided to politely ask one of the workers if our order was almost ready. This worker SNAPPED and replied ""there are only two people working back here!""  Alright lady, not our problem but thanks for letting us know.  After another ten minutes, we finally receive our food. I mean we were waiting around for 40 minutes for 4 tacos! When we get home, we find that the order is wrong! She gave us two orders of chicken tacos with cheese. I am lactose intolerant and allergic. Okay, fine. It was a mistake so we decided to call. I told the lady that answered the phone that it was the wrong order. She snapped and said ""well we only have two workers!"" I'm assuming this is the same young lady that snapped at my husband because she yelled the same thing. Unacceptable! She proceeded to say ""we'll just give you a refund anything else??"" I said no and I asked for her name and she replied ""Claire, anything else??"" Wow. My husband and I decided to let it go but I went back today to place a to-go order. I asked the woman ringing me up for two tacos meat and no cheese to which she replied rudely ""soooo, you just tortilla and meat???"" I said ""no I just don't want any cheese but I want everything else."" She looks up at me miserable and says ""that's what I asked you!"" What. The. Heck?! Why are you so angry, woman!? Like, what is your problem girl?? Do you hate your Job THAT much? I asked for her name because I was curious to see if this was indeed the same rude and obnoxious Claire from last time. Sure enough, it was. I spoke to the manager and he said it was indeed busy that day (as if that's ever an excuse to yell at someone like that). Point of this is that employees should treat customers with mutual respect. If you are that miserable and hate your job that much, find another one and don't take it out on everyone else. I just came for the tacos, minus the cheese and attitude.",-0.9755
"Pass on this place! When 30% of your menu is burritos then you shouldn't be burning them. Both burritos burnt then they tried to hide it. Gross and untrustworthy restaurant! This is the same crap they tried selling in Lutz. There is way to many places in the area to spend your money on the junk. Three people cost $90 with tip. Don't be the sucker like I was and wasted my money and lunch time.",-0.7103
"Worst Taco Bell in the area. Mentally challenged staff, the cashier said it's the LAW that they can't serve the power menu after 10pm. Wow .. full retàrd. Went to a diff Taco Bell got the items I wanted no problem. No wonder it's always empty at this location at night.",-0.8225
"This place has never been the greatest but recently it is worse.

The other day I ordered a whole chicken which only comes with potatoes.  I ordered a side of rice, beans and a salad at $3.00 each thinking it would be enough for 2 people.  Wow was I dissapointed the portion was barely enough for one.

This place absolutely sucks.  Next time I will make the trip into Tampa where they have WAY better Colombian restaurants and a lot cheaper.  Also, the staff consist of young good looking ladies who don't seem to know anything about working in a restaurant.  Absolutely HATE this place.  Do NOT go there.",-0.5737
"I came here because it's the closest Taco Bell to my parents house & obviously because it's fast & cheap when you're hungry on the go. I arrived to their drive thru around 6:45PM with just one person ahead of me. I drove up to put in my order they told me to please hold. No big deal took a few moments but he got my order in & my order was correct on the screen. I go around to pay & they took my payment immediately & gave me my drink & asked for what kinda of sauce I wanted about 5 mins go by & a girl tells me to pull up to the front that they're waiting on the fries.... I said okay no problem! again, none of this was an issue. But for this being a fast food joint & you know these fries are a limited edition item that would possibly be the most ordered item on the menu atm you should have them ready ? Was a thought. About 25 minutes go by that I didn't even notice because I was waiting watching YouTube videos. My order finally comes out! No I'm sorry for the delay, not an extra anything because of the wait as a sorry no nothing. It was handed to me w. A face as if I was inconvenience lol that's strange because I didn't turn in your Taco Bell application you did. So do your job right. I check my bag to see if everything was right like the receipt printed. I had no napkins, no sauces, no forks for my meal & xtra sour cream on my nacho fries that specifically said & repeated that I didn't want sour cream on it was also stated on the receipt. The food was good still I just didn't appreciate the lack of customer service nor did I appreciate the amount of time I had to wait considering we all go here cause it's fast & cheap no matter if there is a line. Also I'd like to add when I came in to get the sauces they forgot to give me. And It's hard for me to even complain about this because I adore dogs oh so much !!! But how can you allow ppl to bring their full size dogs there ? That's a health hazard in a food place. If you had a outdoor seating area it'd be a little different.",-0.9463

"I went with my girlfriend and our two young children. It took a long time to have a server finally come over and greet us after we were seated. Then, they got my girlfriends drink order incorrect. A simple and common mistake, so I thought nothing of it. But then it really went downhill. 

We asked for queso a couple of times before finally getting it. Then my disappointing margarita was barely palatable. To make matters worse, my son's meal came out incorrect and  it took inexplicably long period of time it to correct it. 

My daughter was craving a hotdog, and she was thrilled when we told her it on the menu. It came with fries that were halfway cooked and therefore hard as a rock. 

The service was abysmal. I could hardly ever find our server. I finally got frustrated and actually got up from the table to find him to tell him we were ready for our check. 

The sad part is that the food was decent but the service and lack of attention to customers and detail is this restaurant's downfall. My family and I will never return, and that truly is a shame.",-0.9168
"Pricey and not a lot of toppings for what you pay. You can go to moes and get more bang for your buck (free chips and salsa, plus A LOT more toppings). Only meat, rice, beans and salsa here on the burrito. Edible but nothing I can't make at home",-0.0516

"Have eaten here several times over the past year. Initially, the food was decent/good in my opinion. It's probably closer to authentic Mexican food after observing whose been cooking it from my guess. The last time I had ordered, I was told they had run out of the tomatillo sauce when I had gone to pick up the order. I was a little annoyed because if I had known, I would have ordered something else. This evening, when deciding what to get for dinner we decided to give it another try. Ordered the same enchiladas with tomatillo sauce. As always, ordered to go because it's not that nice to eat there. When we opened our dishes at home we were greeted with no sauce on anything, 2 enchiladas in one dish and three in the other, and a side of white rice! I've never had plain white rice at any Mexican establishment. I basically think this place is going under and they are making cut backs. Unfortunately when it comes to food I think this is a poor decision as it will only lend itself to poor reviews and dissatisfied customers. I feel bad for them as they can make decent food but have no business sense. I guess that was the last straw for me. Back to Tijuana flats which is the closest thing on this side if town.",-0.9179

We came with our young toddler, our server seemed immediately annoyed, I let it go until a second table sat across the aisle from us. Then it was apparent we received a lesser dining experience, me and my wife both work in hospitality so fortunately for him I still tipped over 20%.

Not even an apology, it felt like I was burdening then by asking for the rest of the food. I'm sure this review won't make much of a difference, but I at least needed to vent somewhere. ‍",-0.292

The food was very salty and tasteless. I order a Ancho Grilled Angus Steak Burrito but was brought out a chicken burrito instead. By the time a new one would have been brought out my family would have been done eating. My husband and son only ate half of what they order. This was a big disappointment to us.",-0.6059

"Probably the worst restaurant service I have ever encountered. I was trying to schedule a catering order for an event, and the manager worked it out with me (though was very flaky). The manager left abruptly and apparently did not tell the owner about our order, who then complained greatly about having to fulfill the obligation. He tried to make me feel like I was unreasonable and demanding, when I had been flexible and accommodating for months to work with them because I wanted to give a smaller establishment business. The food was fine, but I was greatly disappointed in the encounter and honestly, it was not worth the hastle.",-0.4383

The place has terrible customer service, long wait times and is expensive

I also never received my chips and guacamole and my tortillas were completely cold, like it's been sitting out. I had to drive 15 minutes out of my way to get my food correctly and when I arrived I was appalled by the customer service I received by a 5'2 Hispanic female with a tattoo on her chest and a Spanish accent. She stated to me that I had to get back in line in order to get my food fulfilled, she did not offer me a refund for my inconvenience of driving and my food being incorrect. While I was in line their was a door dash personnel getting an order and she asked what the order was and as she explained what it was, she cut her off and said ""oh no. I cannot fulfill that order, we are going to have to cancel. I do not have the food, Or do it partial."" All this happened at roughly 9:30pm.

The way the employees interact with their surroundings as far as picking up stuff off the floor then taking cash while proceeding to bag my food with the same gloves. Also cross contamination with the beans and different meat using the same spoon, just slopping my food with dry ass rice and wet ass beans. Super unpleasant.

Guacamole is in desperate need of salt and the salsa taste like marinara sauce with no spice or flavor other than tomato.

I decided to call them at 0925 pm, no one answered the phone although the business hours is until 1000pm. I will never spend a dime at Chipotle ever again!

Occasionally, our server would fumble with his mask and pull it up, then down, then run his hands through his hair repeatedly.  Drinks finally arrive and margaritas spill all over the table but he never cleans it up, so I go the bar to get napkins myself.  He kept apologizing for the bad service citing, ""because these are ""weird times"" man"" and we keep firing the hostesses.  Food finally arrives, no silver or napkins, so I get them myself and everything is super-smoky and salty.  

1 pitcher of margaritas, 1 nacho and 2 entrees-75.00 for some of the worst Mexican food and drink ever.  And we had to sit and watch our server ogle the young lady at the bar (she seemed like she worked there but was off, but she got a lot of ""service"") whose shorts were so short that her multiple trips to the restroom became the floor show (we actually saw it all).

"Literally the worst service experience you could ever have in this area:

1. Primary bartender is always high and spends all her time with people at the bar rather than he regular customers (we have been there 4 times in the past month average check of $80)
2. Secondary bartender is just as bad and does not at all check on tables because she is too focused on the mounds of glassware left to clean at close
3. Kitchen is the slowest you will ever see. We only order eggs and potatoes but it takes 45 minutes EVEN when nobody is there eating!
4. Have never seen a manager
5. Icee machines all empty
6. Glory Days kicks their ass in every way

They don't want to refill because Its lye. I het it but your house say until 10:00 pm. I left and a young man was disrespectful to me on my way out. There are other places to spend my money. Chipotle won't be a place I return to in the future.

"Very disappointed that this location is not better prepared for crowds before the bucs game. They were very unorganized and service was terribly slow. Large crowd of people standing around the bar, drinking and blocking walkways for the servers. They were very loud and made sitting a nearby booth very unpleasant. Skillet queso came out luke warm, twice. Will not be returning to this location in the near future.",-0.9344

Had to dispute the charge with my credit card company. Never ordering from here again. Horrible customer service!!!",-0.8928

"Chili's you have let me down. Every single time I come to this location, it is a bad experience. I have tried so many times with them and it just doesn't ever work out. My husband is already not a fan, but always deals with it for me. 

I was having a rough day and I begged my husband to come here so I could get some chips and queso and grab some dinner. He gave in and we decided to come.

To start with, we walked in and there was nobody at the hostess stand. There were plenty of servers standing around and talking, but not one of them came over and acknowledged us. Even the MANAGER looked at us and just kept walking. Apparently, this location doesn't believe in team work. We waited about ten minutes, if not more before a hostess came up front and greeted us and took us to our table.

Once we sat down, we put in the order for our chips and queso and I ordered a strawberry margarita and my husband ordered the house margarita. The server asked me if I wanted sugar or salt and I said sugar. When our drinks came out, i got a house margarita with sugar? At this point, I didn't care, we already waiting so long just to get acknowledged that at this point, a drink was a drink. I asked the server about the mix up and he said that he thought i wanted the house with sugar. I mean maybe some people prefer that, but I personally have never heard or seen anyone with a regular house margarita with sugar.

Our food came out, I got chicken fajitas and my husband a burger, thankfully our food was cooked correctly. It did take a while to come out, but at this point I wasn't even surprised anymore at the service we had been receiving.

Overall, I have given this location multiple chances and it is such a shame because they are in a good area that is close and convenient. Sadly, the service is horrible. I still can't get over the fact that the manager ignored us knowing we walked in and there wasn't a hostess found.

"I've been to Miguelitos before but I'm convinced I'll not be back...

On NYE, my girlfriend and I decided to get dinner here. Our waitress was really nice, but seemed a little frazzled (or busy though it wasn't that busy) for whatever reason. We order our drinks, our appetizers, and some waters. We get out appetizers, our drinks, and then we waited 15 minutes for our waters. 

Keep in mind, I paid $6-7 for ""Chiles Con Queso"" which has no description and no real translation so when I'm looking at a tiny puddle of cheese in a small bowl, I asked the waitress only to find out it's exactly what I ordered. Disappointing to say the least. 

Additionally, my first drink was made by the waitress herself because there were no bartenders at the time we had been seated (after 7p.) 

To add insult to injury, as the waitress is taking our food from (a 4 person) our table, she proceeds to drop a piece of silverware with oil on me rather than taking the empty plates and used silverware over the chair no one sat in.",-0.9629

I have been to many Mexican restaurants in the area, and I am sad to say that the food here had no flavor. I ordered a #9 combo which included 2 tacos, 2 enchiladas. I ordered 4 different meats, Asada, El Pastor, Barbarcoa and Pollo. When the plate arrived to the table, I was confused because there were 3 tacos, and a pile of lettuce covered in sour cream. I was informed I was given a free taco , and the enchiladas were below the lettuce. Very disappointing as none of them had any decernable  flavor, they were all just blah. Sure, if you add sauce to it there would be flavor but I would expect to taste a little sweetness in the El Pastor, or saltiness in the Asada. There was none.

If you want good tacos, go to the place a block away!",-0.3316

"The food was just ok. Dry and bland, I had the chimichanga. But what really got me about this place was the astronomical prices. They put Disney to shame for some of these meals, not at all worth it. Went on national margarita day and they had no specials at all. Obviously it's not a must but you would think a place called señor tequilas would have some sort of deal going on. Don't think I'll ever go back. Just not worth the money.",-0.8537

My bowl was missing double chicken and steak literally the protein of the meal. The kids quesadilla didn't come with rice and beans just a sad piece of tortilla with barely any cheese in it. I called the store and spoke with ""VIc"" who addressed himself as the manager and stated he would be refunding my meals and that I would get confirmation of such. This was on Tuesday 5/25 and it's Friday, it does not take that long to process something of this nature. Aside from leaving this review I'll also be writing corporate.",-0.8807

When I told the waitress she said they were fresh and they were just made. She offered to reheat the tacos. I refuse to have reheated tacos so I declined. The waitress told the owner and they offered to only charge me for the enchiladas and the drink I consumed. So I ended up paying $7.50 for the worst lunch I've had in a while. I will not be returning and would not recommend this place to anyone. When I told the owner how bad the tacos were he said that's impossible because they are made to order. He refused to believe the meat was room temperature. Next time I'll go to the food truck across the street!",-0.6251

Today, as I handed my card to the girl in the window, she was busy breaking a roll of coins into the till. With my card in one hand she found a coin that caught her attention for whatever reason & proceeded to show it to a few of her coworkers. There was a line of probably 8 cars behind me- it was around 12pm. One if them finally said something that got her to refocus on her job. I had to ask her for hot sauce. I didn't check the bag before pulling away from the window & sure enough, pintos & cheese had translated to cheese dip & chips. I parked, went inside, told another cashier my order was wrong & because they hadn't given me a receipt, I couldn't show whether i'd been charged. Whatever- it's $1.60. So I pay for a new pintos & cheese. Once on the interstate I pull it out of the bag- they forgot my damn spork. GRRRRR!!!

He didn't return so I left my car and went inside only to see this boy taking the people who followed him in orders. Meanwhile my food was sitting there getting cold. This restaurant is extremely expensive and I didnover $30 for cold food and no service. What is the point in contactless service if that is not what you deliver? I don't know if I was exposed to the virus because this restaurant didn't follow their own protocol. I will never go back there unless they make things right. Cold food I paid thirty dollars for Is unexceptable. Think long and hard before you order from Lolis on Hillsborough because you don't know what you are bring exposed to.

"I wouldn't say I'm a regular but I do come here from time to time. I always get a fresh water of pineapple. I came like any other day to grab the same drink. But this time it had way too much pulp, I could not drink it. I asked if I could switch to a jarrito (soda) and that I'd pay the difference. The owner, told the waiter to tell me I'd have to pay for another drink. I tried asking him nicely why would I have to pay if I literally just bought it and was unable to drink it and opened the drink and showed him how much pulp it had. He was very aggressive in talking back to me, mind you I'm pregnant. I told him I always go there for the same drink and it never has had so much pulp. He said he didn't care that he always makes it the same and that I could exchange it for another ""agua fresca"" but not a soda. (Which the waiter had already told me was just a 4 cent difference) So I asked him what the difference in that was if it was the same price. That I wasn't going to get a water I did not like. He could not explain why I couldn't get a soda and at the end was rude saying well If you want a soda you can only change it for a pineapple jarito. Did not let me choose, and was very rude about it.

Service was terrible and VERY slow! We arrived at just before 12:40 and didn't get our meals until 1:05 - place wasn't even close to being half-full. My friend had to change her order because they were out of pork. Then they came back to say they were out of shrimp. She ended up with chicken fajitas that she said were very bland. Even my burritos deluxe were screwed up! The ""beef and beans"" one had no beans, and the ""chicken and beans"" one had chicken fajita filling (note: green peppers make me extremely ill!) and nary a bean in site!  The side of rice I ordered was so nuked that it was stuck to the bowl! When the waitress arrived with our meals, I asked her to please bring us some to-go containers, as we didn't have enough time to eat and still get back to the office on time. She never brought them. Took forever to get a refill on my iced tea -- I was starting to think she had gone to Ceylon to pick the tea leaves! After about 5 minutes of eating, I had to flag down a busboy to ask him for the containers and our check.

"I've been frequenting this restaurant for years now. And with any typical Latin restaurant there are inconsistencies. Being of Latin dissent this is something you deal with. But this evening was my last straw with this restaurant. Not only are the portions smaller I'm paying the same price for dinner and the portions servings I'm getting are lunch sizes. So dinner just cost me $30 which i was given about $15 worth of food. In addition to that as I place my order they won't let me pay with cash when I get there which is fine I understand people bail on phone orders so I had to pay with my card over the phone which I don't like doing. Then on my way to driving to the restaurant to pick up my food the female restaurant staff employee proceeds to call me and ask me where I am and how much longer before I get there. That my food is waiting. To  then find out that it's not even ready yet and I'm still waiting an extra 10 minutes . this evening if pizza was going to cost $20 I thought  Viejo would cost $20 needless to stay I spent $10 more than I wanted to spend got a smaller portion of meal . I would've got more food from pipos, ybor city grill or la Teresita . Then when my order is finally ready . I find out they don't even  fill my full order correctly and left out my black beans and grilled onions on both steak orders. at this point they have officially lost my business. the inconsistencies for one thing to deal with when you order one kind of steak but get another one misinterpretations over the phone kitchen staff's not everybody speaks English I understand that I work in the kitchen myself however all of this on top of everything else with this place has me looking for a new local Spanish restaurant.",-0.5118

When she came to the table and we told her about the unpalatable food, she took them and said ""oh!"" I suppose when she got to the kitchen someone then told her to ask if we wanted a replacement because she literally returned to the table and said, ""so you want something else?"" It's the worst experience I've had at a restaurant. We were in town for a conference. I'm actually part of the executive team for the conference. I would never recommend this place going forward.

"My first time coming to this chipotle location and if I could give this location zero stars I would. The customer service was subpar no hospitality and the employees on the line as well as the cashier all seemed as if they had an attitude. No, I will say that it was around 6:30 PM that I got there and this may have been their dinner time rush, but that is no excuse for poor service. The employees were moving very slow and we're not accommodating at all. One employee, I did not get her name because none of them were wearing nametags, even made a snarky remark about my order. There were no beans no white rice no fajitas no chicken and instead of telling me they could work on some fajitas they just told me there was not any. Now, if there was a shortage and onions and peppers then I could understand that, but I don't think Covid would cause such issues. When it was time for me to get the chicken, that was not already prepared, the employee told me well we will go cut some chicken right now I waited there for maybe five minutes waiting for the chicken to be cut for the balls. That same employee kept calling out the needs for the line and no other employee jumped to replenish The food that they had run out of. This is the worst experience I have had at any chipotle I have ever been to and I frequent chipotle very often.I will be sure to never visit this location again and highly suggest to anyone reading this review they take heed and avoid this location as well unless you don't mind waiting for over 35 minutes and getting poor customer service and your order only have to fulfill due to lack of preparation.",-0.9866

I came in and addressed the cashier, Tatiana, told her what I ordered, & asked her to touch the cold food, as well as see the order. I was then interrupted by Mona asking was this an online order. I replied excuse me I was speaking with the cashier. Mona went back to the line to start making food and Tatiana apologized for the interruption and asked would I like the food remade or a refund. I requested a refund. She explained Mona was the manager and she had to wait for her approval while calling her. Mona visibly upset stopped helping customers that were in line to tell me I yelled at her and was rude at which I responded I didn't yell - however, you did interrupt and let you know I was speaking to the cashier. Mona continued to make food as we waited for her to do the refund and after 10 minutes I called for her asking did she intend on completing the refund. She then mocked and repeated this is why I tried to help and I replied but you interrupted, then said I yelled, when no one was yelling. She interrupted again and said I was rude. I smiled and said Mona, you just interrupted me again, if you would take the time to listen to the customer, she interrupted again then stormed off in the opposite direction. 

I feel terrible for her teammates that saw the behavior and the customers in the restaurant. I won't boycott Chipotle of anything, but perhaps this is an opportunity for the staff to learn etiquette and handle the situation at least promptly. Because Mona was so upset that I told her excuse me I was speaking, she could not do her job, and refund the money. 

She was only focused on telling me I yelled and was rude when in fact I should be the one frustrated at the cold food & wrong order.",-0.9725

"To start off with, I downloaded this app just to ensure this review was written! I ordered chips and salsa for an appetizer for our table of 8-I ask for pico (keep in mind I frequently go to Chilis, including this one at least 1-2x a month) the waitress rolls her eyes (one of many times I might add) and tells me that her manager is making her charge me for the salsa, that is for the order of chips and salsa... I truly do not understand that (however it's not the charge that is frustrating it's the problem with inconsistent service-I have never been charged for the pico). 
Next, one of our friends ordered a drink that she didn't like at all and didn't want it due to being way too strong for her-the waitress once again does a deep sigh and rolls her eyes, AGAIN... HOW DOES THIS WOMAN MAKE A LIVING IN CUSTOMER SERVICE WITH HER ATTITUDE?! 
Third, I asked for extra napkins (she brought 5 total in beg for a table of 8) and she decided to bring an entire unopened pack of napkins to our table and basically grabs out half the bag and put on our table and rolled her eyes AGAIN and walked away with an attitude as if we were bothering her... 
In essence, she was very RUDE, not friendly, horrible attitude and incredibly unprofessional and I will never spend another dollar at this location EVER AGAIN!!!! And neither should you!!!",-0.5952

I'm writing this review in hopes they can clean up their act. Twice I reach out to voice my concerns and no response at all.

Ordered food for take out and absolutely nothing was edible. Food was cold. Mahi was not anything that could be called fish. Shrimp tempura taco was a disaster. The rice was cold and tasteless.

"Got here on Halloween night and proceeded to order 4 tacos (2 pastor and 2 steak) and an order of guac and chips. Immediately tell us there is no pastor left so we switch to 3 steak and 1 barbacoa. Go and sit down and this is where the disaster starts. Waitress comes out and spills beer over the customer sitting next to us so I'm like here we go. 10 minutes later we get our tacos and our chips at the same time. Who doesn't want their chips and Guac prior to getting their food? Ok cool. Steak looks like it was sitting for weeks and was completely dried out. We ask for lime which any respectable taco joint would already provide with your tacos, and they come out and bring us some lime juice in a cup... what? Chips were from a Tostitos bag when they used to be homemade. Flavorless food will never be back. It's a shame when places get a little bit of popularity they start cutting corners. This place will be lucky to be open past Christmas. Never again. Do yourself a favor and literally go to ANY other taco stand.

Edit not Barbocoa, chorizzo. Regardless. Then the owner wants to talk tough and insult me instead of apologizing and asking what can be done to fix the issue. Go check out google reviews and see how insulting and rude she is.",-0.3589

She hands me 4 cups without a drink carrier like I can haul all 4 and my food out to my car by myself lol then I get my food and realize I'm missing half my order. I went back in, told them I'm missing my chip and cheese and two soft shell tacos with no lettuce. They give me my food again and I leave and I check my food and they literally give me two tacos with lettuce.

At 7:35 nothing so I asked about the order and was told I did not place anything so I showed them my confirmation and they wrote my order down and I thought we're making it!  More orders came out and at 8:00 asked agai n about my order once I finally stopped being ignored (including who I think was the manager on duty) and was told the same thing!  I unfortunately had to get rude and show my email confirmation from an hour prior and where bank account was charged and then they finally filled the order and handed it to me with not even an apology!

Sorry I did. The Guacamole was watery and tasteless. If you can't make better Guacamole then chipotle ( they list there ingredients, just copy it ) you shouldn't sell it.

I have to say that we didn't like the concept, the service or the food.. this place is more for people having a beer and something to eat..when you enter you go straight to the bar area to order, no time to see the menu really good, than you sit wherever you like and you have to pick up the food, nobody ask us if the food was good.. the food is tasteless except for a green spicy salsa that is was kind of good but really small portions, all the soda in the soda machine taste awful except for the lemonade.. if you like to drink, have a beer, watch sports and have something's to eat, this is your place! The young lady at the register was friendly but she was kind of rushing us with her looks for us to order the food, I told her it was our first time there and she didn't recommend any food or drinks, the place was clean so I don't think people has to worried about covid..for us, sadly I don't think we're coming back",-0.746

Ordered a simple 3 item order on my app thinking it was gonna be easy to pickup and properly made 
Little did I know I show up with my order not ready at all come to find out someone messed it up which I understand people make mistakes . 
Then I wait about 20 min for a person to hand me another wrong bag , so after fixing that issue I finally was able to leave the store with my food , as  soon as I get back in my car I wanted to have a taste of my burrito and chips and queso ordered , yet again another mistake after another , they decided to only give me chips without queso lol and my burrito was cold as if it's been sitting somewhere before I even arrive I mean come on steak not being hot whatsoever even though it's literally grilled and chopped and kept under a heater . Incredible and the only thing that's at least lukewarm were the beans 
That is truly a disgrace to my Hispanic heritage and I don't advise even trying to go here when it's on a weekend , but lesson learned I'm gonna make sure to check on my local moes next time where even when busy they at least cook my food correctly especially after my order has been messed up in the first place.",-0.5819

However the worst part was not the wait for the food, but the gentleman in the kitchen referring to his crew of young adults working there as ""idiots"" and saying ""We need to quit hiring from the high school next door.""  Here's a hint: don't bad-mouth your staff to the customers, it's not a good look.

It was topped with lettuce and a tomato but underneath was a liquid that took up half of the taco salad. We thought it was cheese but it was more of a watery consistency. This seemed more of a taco salad soup because it was so soupy. We told the waiter that this didn't look right but he stated that it looked normal to him. Not to mention there was no chicken in it at all. He apologized and brought out more chicken. She gave the taco ""soup"" back because it wasn't what she wanted so she just ate the chicken that was given after on the side. After we got the bill the waiter charged us for the taco salad on top of a charge for a side of chicken. After disputing the charge he refunded the taco ""salad"".

"Without exaggeration this is the worst chipotle I've ever been to. The place has been on a constant downward slope for years now that I cannot even remember the last time I had a quality visit. I don't even know why I continue to come here expecting things to be different. Today was the last straw. The place was ridden with flies, the entire behind glass kitchen and area was a mess with food, empty containers, trash, etc.. the entire building was dirty with food and trash on the tables, chairs, and floors, puddles on the ground, and full trash cans. Literally every single trash can was full. There was no ice, no napkins, no silverware, and the employees were rude to every customer who asked for them at the counter. The water cups we got were dirty, the cashier grabbed our forks with his dirty glove, and they had headphones In. I watched multiple employees ignore the trash, mess, and missing ice as they would go get themselves drinks, see that there was no ice and a mess in the restaurant, and move on ignoring it. Terrible disgusting place with horrible food quality and employees who openly could not possibly care less. This place used to be great but for the past 2-3 years it feels like it's run by teenagers or adults who seem to act like teenagers who lack any management, and quit within a week of working as they are constantly in need of employees and have new ones every time we go in. I'm not asking for much it's quite literally the bare minimum of the job yet they still can't even accomplish that. 
I understand that the work doesn't match the pay but we've all had bad jobs before. You knew what the job was when you took it. Literally the bare minimum. Wipe off the tables and seats, sweep, refill silverware, refill napkins, refill ice, take the trash out, clean the work area as you work. Done.

"I have enjoyed this place in the past, but today was not one of those days. I hate to repeat some of the other posts, but I feel it is necessary.  The experience started of bad, as I ordered carnitas tacos. The server returned to tell me they were out of carnitas. Ok, so I ordered shrimp tacos instead. A couple minutes later another person came to tell me they were also out of shrimp and waiting for a delivery. I settled on the chicken fajita lunch dish. After waiting 30 minutes during a very not-crowded lunch, our food arrived. (I might add that I have no issue waiting on great food that takes more time to prepare). We immediately asked for boxes since we were running out of time, but the server appeared to be too busy talking with another server. We ended up asking someone else for the boxes and the bill, so we could take the food to go. The chicken fajitas were bland - and nothing like the millions of other fajitas I've consumed in my lifetime. The rice seemed to be of a microwaved variety, and I'm pretty certain they forgot the condiments that usually come with the fajitas. My friend's food turned out to be incorrect, there were zero beans in her burritos deluxe. One of them even had peppers and onions, which she can't eat either of. Overall, the food was not very good and the service was poor.  Very disappointing.",-0.9009

I explained to him that was impossible I paid $30 for three tacos seriously!!. Then he said that they couldn't find my receipt in their system and showed me a receipt of $12 as an example of what an order of birria tacos would cost which I told him that if I paid $30 than I should've two for that price. His attitude really disrespectful and when I ask him well we're is my consommé he told me that he didn't bring it because we have been talking all this time...... seriously!!!

"EXTREMELY OVERPRICED, OVER-SALTED AND TINY PORTIONS

Pardon for the late review, but I was just released from the hospital after suffering a stroke from the amount of SODIUM I ingested at Taco Salty (I mean, Dirty). 

Seriously, if you spend any amount of time eating out or cooking, you know that over-salting food is the first sign of a HORRIBLE restaurant. And yes, Taco Salty (Dirty) is indeed a HORRIBLE restaurant. Here's why:

1. As I said before, everything from the meats to the veg and even the fucking tortillas (who the fuck thinks putting seasoning on tortillas is a good idea? whoever you are, you are FIRED from this earth) are over-seasoned and over-salted. Here's an idea: Why don't you allow your ingredients to speak for themselves? Is it because your ingredients are shit?

2. Extremely expensive for the amount of food you get. 1 bowl and 3 tiny tacos (mine were on lettuce leaves) were $30. A tremendous rip-off. The steak, pork, shrimp was all pure sodium. So were the veg. Nothing spectacular for the $30. Nothing was addictive, not the meats, not the sauces; everything was just super salty ordinary food. It's like Chipotle with more sauces and toppings but WAYYYYYYY SALTIER. No Coca-Cola products. Fuck that shit they have in the fountain. It tastes like ass. 

3. Extremely loud music. If you don't get a headache from the amount of salt in the food, you will certainly get a headache from the super-loud tacky shit music.

4. Parking is a hassle. Don't go here unless it's 3 or 4 p.m. or some other off time. Otherwise you will get pissed off at the parking situation.

5. Extremely confusing menu/ordering process. I really wasn't in the mood to have to study a fucking menu for 10 minutes on a Sunday just to order 3 tacos. I still don't get the menu. The same person who decided to put red, Old Bay-style seasoning on the tortillas must be the one who designed the menu. Moron.

6. The fact that so many Tampa people have given this place 4 and 5 stars makes me weep for the future of our country.",-0.9958
"Hate to leave a negative review, but Totally a disappointment.  They didn't have the food that was on their website and the entree came out cold and at the same time as chips and salsa.

"Tonight was the worse restaurant experience my wife and I have ever had.  I went to a Taco Shop and got fish tacos 10x worse than the ones I make at home.  The fish was like chewing rubber.  Just horrible, my beans and rice were cold, I'm talking ice cold. We paid $28 for 2 beers and $3 worth of food product.  We'll never go back, trust me, stay away....",-0.8403
"Consistently downhill at this location, unfortunately. Last straw was to go order for 7pm that wasn't ready until 7:50pm combined with over 60 people inside (no social distancing) and employee masks below their noses and our extra rice burrito with carnitas was about half the size of a typical burrito. Skip this location...flavors were good but I'm going elsewhere.",-0.0785

"Very crowded and very slow. Took an hour to get our food. They also do not clean the counters and I got corn in my burrito when I did not order corn.

Also they had gloves on but touched their hats, their aprons, etc.",-0.3567
"TLDR : The food used to be great, the customer service has really gone down hill.  Maybe I expect the quality to be the same as it was when they only had one restaurant, sadly the experience has changed!  (This review was written based on the original restaurant on Benjamin Rd, on 8/3/2020)

Review:
On Monday 8/3/2020 I ordered 12 tacos, 6 pastor and 6 shrimp.  I requested and paid ($2.10) for extra pineapple for the pastor.  In the past requesting extra pineapple would mean 2-3 pieces of pineapple per taco which basically gives you a little piece of pineapple per bite.  Out of my 6 tacos I had a total of 5 pieces of pineapple.  I was really disappointed to get all the way home and find out, not only did I get less pineapple than normal, but I actually paid extra and got less than the normal amount.

I requested 2 red salsas and 8 green.  For 12 tacos I should receive close to 12 salsas.  Typically I can even use all of the salsa they give me.  I received 3 red and 2 green.  I had my latin in laws in town and I was excited to show them lolis's but they were disappointed and thought the tacos were dry (probably because we did not get the pineapple we paid for or the salsa we requested).

In the past when I order the shrimp tacos I've always been impressed with the amount of shrimp in the tacos.  Typically you would get 3-4 shrimps per taco.  In this experience the two Shrimp tacos I ate only had 2 shrimp each.  I am not sure if this is the new normal or we just got jipped again.

After talking up Lolis for a while before my in laws came they were pretty disappointed with the lack luster food.  I can not blame them, it was way under par from what I have experienced in the past.

I called Lolis and I requested the manager, I explained the above complaints.  The manager put me on hold for about 5 minutes and then came back to the phone to tell me he wasn't going to do anything about it because his crew assured him I was wrong and basically called me a liar.  

I let him know this would be the last time I would eat at their restaurant.  This really disappointed me because I had been going out of my way to support this restaurant multiple times during the pandemic. 

I understand we all have bad days, I understand sometimes a restaurant is really busy and things are not perfect, but the way the manager treated me after my experience was the final nail in the coffin, and I am sad to say that was my last time eating at or recommending Lolis.",-0.9788
"Went here for first time instead of driving to Moes. I told the ladies preparing food that it was our first time there and they were very helpful. As we moved down to register I asked for the combo several times. Guy rang it up and handed us cups. I asked where are the chips? He said oh you've got to order those seperate. How does a combo not have chips? $19 for 2 bland bowls. No salsa, no flavor. I don't understand how this place can be open. The food is so inferior to Moes and you don't get chips with your combo. Didnt even have cilantro or fresh jalapeños. When the Moes opens up on E 60 I cant imagine this place will last. A complete ripoff.",-0.4326
"We have had multiple bad experiences at Taco Dirty but this one was by far the worst. We placed an order online for pick up and when calling to check the time for the order, the restaurant was unresponsive. When we went to pick up our food, no one, including staff, were wearing masks properly or following/enforcing safe social distancing measures. We attempted to call again to see if curbside pick up would be available but, again, no answer. We ended up canceling our order through the service we used to place the order. Safe to say, we will no longer be patrons of Taco Dirty.",-0.9246
"Ordered this online and opened it up once home. Pretty pathetic to say the least. Basically soup. No rice (asked for brown rice), 6 beans, three small pieces of sofritas and what seems to be a whole lot of water?? Wouldn't call myself picky but I won't be eating this for dinner.",-0.2982
"The absolute worst staff of anywhere I have eaten in 30 years. The ""I hate my job and don't care about serving customers"" look and attitude from the workers is glaringly obvious. As others have mentioned, they are constantly out of items on the line and don't seem to care. There seems to be lots of people employed but rarely more than 1 person making food for those dining in causing long lines that don't move and numerous people waiting for call in orders standing around pissed off because this place can't get the food out. Save yourself the aggravation and go elsewhere! This place needs corporate to come in, fire everyone including the manager who apparently doesn't know how to hire good workers or staff for peak times. If this is franchised, the person should be stripped of this store. Either fix it or close it down as it is ruining your brand which at other locations is good.",-0.7367

Mark was our server. First and last time here. I don't know what the hype is about this place. The server seemed to be on something seemed like he was drunk or even on cocaine.",-0.6124

"This place is not the same. I had a 5 star review on here before and I'm changing it to one star. I don't know what is going on with their kitchen but it's fallen apart. I've been ordering takeout from here on a weekly basis for the past 6 months or so on either Uber Eats or the Fuzzys website, since this place is very close to where I live. Won't be getting food here anymore. Got my order wrong every time in the last 5 or so orders. Once I ordered fish but got chicken, which was very upsetting as I don't eat meat, only seafood and realized this halfway into eating my burrito. The ""jumbo"" burritos are no longer jumbo at all. I ordered a quesadilla last night and asked to substitute black beans for chicken and what they threw on there was in no way comparable to the amount of chicken you would get. The quesadilla was flat as a pancake and it was more tortilla than anything. Hardly anything on it. Hardly any cheese. Lower quality than Taco Bell, yet costs $10. They used to place the burritos on the flat top and give the top and bottom a really good warm golden crispy top and bottom. Now they skip that step and serve the burritos cold. Same with the quesadilla. Not crispy at all. Didn't even eat it. Threw it in the trash.",-0.8093
"This location just sucks period! From their customer service being terrible. They're always running out of food. Food tasting bland. One time we had the rice not have a single grain of cilantro. Online orders placed way ahead of time are never ready when picked up. It's all bad. Sucks cuz we love chipotle and it's the only one near us. We keep trying to give them chances but they keep failing. I've emailed corporate and all I get is basically a ""sorry not sorry"" email.",-0.8749
"I'm very disappointed. I ordered quite a few things here and most of the order came out raw as on pink ground beef and tacos did not even have the correct toppings. Ordered two burritos and some tacos also came in an hour before closing time and waited 45 minutes for my order.",-0.5256
"I would give them zero stars. They are slow, they never have ingredients , and there employees are poorly managed. There are 8 people working behind the counter but only one person taking orders. The line is almost through the door. I waited in line for 35 mins on a Sunday, long enough to write this horrible review. I'll be going to Moes southwest grill. Cause chipotle has really downgraded its self.",-0.7709
"We were beyond excited to try this restaurant. The reviews convinced me that this Mexican restaurant was worth it, however it was not. I love horchata but this for me was one of the worst. It was gritty and thick and tasted of actual perfume. I ordered the combo 1 which included 2 tacos and a tostado. I got steak and chicken. These were the most bland meats with absolutely no flavor...literally none. There was also no flavor to the salsa verde. It was basically watered down spices. 

Now my husband got the chorizo and the flavor was out of this world. Wish I would have gotten those. 

I was so disappointed.  I probably won't go back. We took pictures but the pictures look way better than they tasted. I'm from Chicago and I know good Mexican food.....sigh. The search continues.",-0.7615
"Two weeks who on a Saturday my boyfriend and I sat at the bar, we had beyond horrible customer service from the bartender. Not only was he drunk but rude. He was very condescending to my boyfriend .. chanting his name .. asking if everything was good enough for Harold .. in a condescending tone. This behavior was not appropriate in any arena, let alone a restaurant where we came to spend money. At one point the bartender drunkenly  fell and chanted my boyfriends name from the ground. He broke several glasses. When my boyfriend went to the bathroom, he cleared our drinks and table setting. We were too nervous to ask for another one, thinking he would put something harmful in the drink. We had to leave we were so uncomfortable.  We messaged management and hoped some action would be taken . 

We have dined here before, we love Jackie , she's the best. This is the first bad experience we've had here. Very unfortunate.",-0.8551
"This was by far a disappointment at the least. We ordered at least $50 worth of food and none of our 4 burrito supremes had any meat. We were shorted tacos . We were parked while the short dread haired lady uses the broom on the sensor to bring her times down in compliance. At any job that is deemed automatic termination in fast food.i wouldn't have cared if my food was made incorrectly. We never asked for no meat or a bean burrito.",-0.7044
"I really hope someone from management sees this. I was there for the last time on October 30th. The line was 45 mins long, which tbh is typical for this chipotle. I refuse to order online again because the last time I ordered online my 3 steak tacos had been absolutely drenched in the hot sauce. Anyways, that situation doesn't have to do with what happened on the 30th. 

My main complaints are that the restaurant itself was filthy, inside and out. The bathroom had toilet paper strung across the floor. The tables were all dirty, inside and out. The floor was gross, and the drink station itself  is why I will never give my business to this chipotle, ever again. There was mold growing all along the cracks of the soda fountain. It was so disgusting. I know that these machines require a lot of maintenance, being that I have worked in the food industry the majority of my career. This was the worst I had seen, even worse than McDonald's. It was so bad I had a hard time eating the $35 worth of food I had just paid for. The whole drink station was an absolute wreck, trash everywhere, everything utensil and napkin wise was out of stock. I wish I had taken pictures but I was in a rush at the time. If you value your health, stay far away from this place.",-0.7823
"I don't ever want to give a bad review but if I was the owner I would want to know. The service was bad, every other food option was empty or out. There was food all over the place (it was extremely messy and to be honest just gross). When restocking the food they were cutting bags open on the line refilling in front of the customers rather than filling in the back and bringing it out. The entire experience was just gross...",-0.8636

"Missing item, 2 of the 5 items received were incorrectly prepared - customized to add/remove items, burrito prepared standard, all food was cold, crunchy taco shell was very stale, cinnamon twists tasted burned/cooked in bad oil. Worst Taco Bell experience to date.",-0.7906
"Avoid this location if possible. Absolutely no COVID safety precautions. The workers don't wear masks and the ones that do seem to never change them. One worker in particular had a lot of thread falling from a disposable mask.  To make it worse she touched her mask and then proceeded to touch the food she was preparing. Food is also subpar. 

The morale is also terrible but given the current worker situation I'll let that slide. Overall, avoid this location if possible or just eat somewhere else. Panera is just a few steps away and that place is fantastic.",-0.1567
"Horrible service. Sat down at 730 pm. Went almost 20 minutes before ordering our meals with an additional 30 minutes before receiving them. Getting past the initial drink order we like pulling teeth. We were constantly ignored by our sever. We had to ask anyone who walked by to get additional drinks. Genuinely unimpressed the food was not Mexican, not fast, definitely not organized.",-0.7881

Ordering was fast but the wait was too long.
When received the food, disappointed again.
Chips and cheese bland.
Tacos really boring.",-0.8266
"I ordered nachos, what I got was a plate of about 8 tortilla chips individually piled with cold congealed cheese, refried beans, a dollop of guac & a slice of raw jalapeño. In the middle was a pile of shredded lettuce and diced tomato. I have never had nachos like this before and was expecting something more palatable for the price. Seriously...$10 for 8 chips with cold cheese??  I was thoroughly confused. I was also starving so against my better judgement I ate them... The skinny margarita I ordered wasn't much better. Tasted like it was poured from a pitcher of pre-mix?  I understand most establishments are understaffed right now but I gladly would've waited longer for a tastier dish. Lone bartender wasn't exactly friendly either and seemed bored. Zero chit chat from him even though I was dining solo. Just avoid this place until they get their shit together. 

I really don't understand how this place has so many positive reviews. Tampa just doesn't really have many dining options I guess.",-0.8053
"This is not Mexican Authentic. I'm so disappointed I order tacos because of how the photos looked and I got some saggy version on flour tortilla with white cheese on top , and 2 strips of jalapeño . Not flavor besides SALT , not spicy , not even salsa on my order .

The carnitas and the bean were too salty , the corn (with bacon ???)  rice and poblano soup were terrible :(  if you are Mexican stay away! You won't enjoy it.",-0.9127
"First time at this location and VERY DISAPPOINTED!! If I was able to give no stars I certainly would. Upon first getting to the location it wasn't very busy, however a nice crowd of patrons. I ordered ground beef soft corn shell tacos that barely had meat. The forgot to add the guacamole and sour cream.  Hmph!! Gave them a pass and just thought everyone makes mistakes. I proceeded to make an additional order to take home to my family and again GREATLY DISAPPOINTED!!! Barely meat on the beef or chicken tacos is a understatement. Needless to say this is my first and LAST TIME visiting this location. I'll drive to Brandon on Causeway Blvd.",-0.9026

Place is a mess, unprofessional af",-0.8979
"I am  Mexican guru for food and this was the worst service I have ever had hands down. Our server behind the bar Mark, was very inefficient and coherent on what we wanted. Definitely not experienced and should not be behind the bar. Margaritas tasted like ass and our shots didn't even come chilled like we asked. Horrible advertising if you ask me since they are all about the -5 degrees chilled tequila. Disappointed to say the least.",-0.8176
"So this is my first time visiting the Bloomingdale chipotle location . And I love chipotle never have issues . But this probably has to be the dirtiest chipotle I have ever been to . The  floor is disgusting. I was just surprised bc usually all of the chipotles I go to  are clean, didn't even want to eat my food inside bc of how grossed out I was .  Defiantly won't be returning .",-0.5622
"Came here twice. Everything that can go wrong went wrong. Service is horrible.  Literally cannot find the waiter. Also had to make my own guacamole. The avocados weren't mashed up, and there was no salt . Should've been called an avocado salad since the tomatoes and onions were also huge.

Found a staple in my chili relleno. Luckily I was chewing slowly .",-0.743
"***They're Stealing from customers!***

Well, taking donations without telling customers. It's only $1 but if they do it to 500 people a day, that's $500 they just stole. 

The young man with the face tattoo is charging people for the TB Foundation without disclosing this information. When I asked him about it he said ""we aren't using the drive thru computer so I had to use the front computer"". Whatever that means, I have no idea. He then said ""You want your dollar back?"" I laughed and said no as it would take more time to get it back than its worth. As I drive off he said ""That's why I put it on there"" with a tone in his voice. So I backed up and said ""excuse me?"" A person with a striped shirt on walked up to the window at the same time and the young man changed what he said to me and said ""oh, i was just saying I know to press no from now on when it asks if you want to donate."" 

Also, I think he was so tied up in stealing my money he forgot to give me the sauce packets he asked me if I wanted. So now I'm back at work to feed my office and we have no sauce. 

I can only assume the employee and the store both get some sort of Kudos for selling/stealing donations for this foundation? I'll be going on social media, Google and Yelp later to let everyone know to check their receipts for money being stolen from then without their knowledge.",-0.8715

The entire line was dirty. I had to tell two workers to put on new gloves after coming from the back trying to prepare my food and they were mad about that.

If you'd like to hear more, here you go. I placed an order, through the app, for a pick up time of 6:30. This was not the ""quickest"" time in the app, 6:20 was. When I arrived at 6:28, I sent my son in to pick up the order, expecting it to be ready at 6:30. After standing around for 25 minutes, they still hadn't started our order. Of course there were 9 other people waiting for their order, the longest was waiting 45 minutes. I went in and saw 2 Associates on the line and 6 behind the computer...seeming to be in awe of all the orders coming in. I was tired of waiting and cancelled my order. Why promise your customer it will be ready at a specific time and it's not? Usually, my food arrives earlier than the committed time!

My kids were devastated, but we had to be somewhere by 7 PM, hence why I placed an online order and couldn't wait any longer.

After our commitment was through, they asked if we'd try again at this same restaurant. I told them as long as the line was not too long.

We all decided to go in...there was a line of 3 people and about 18 waiting for their order (again, a customer was waiting 45 minutes). Despite my better judgment, we got in line and ordered 3 bowls. The two young Associates on the line were filling the bowls with the smallest portions I've seen (the customer in front of me began yelling at the kid because he was upset he was getting shorted). Chipotle raised their prices and we want a fair portion. 

Looking at the line, the restaurant was disgustingly dirty. Guac spread on the counter, trash on the floor, meat burning on the grill, and 4 Associates trying to fill the online orders. After the first Associate was done with the rice/beans/meat, he left to go get a drink. Meanwhile, the kid handling the veggies was running out of toppings and was backlogged (I blame the training/supervisors). He looked at me and said that's all the cheese! Like as a customer, I'm supposed to be okay with that? This stopped the line and the other customers behind me were delayed. Why didn't the thirsty Associate lend a hand and help out?

The cheese was replenished and we got our food, small portions and not hot. To say I was very disappointed is an understatement. This store needs to be fixed, from a Leadership standpoint. Very poorly ran. Avoid at all costs...",-0.9344

"Tonight my mother and aunt went into this establishment for dinner. They were taken to a table where the air conditioning was uncomfortable, they asked for the air to be adjusted but their server said she could not. While dining they were disrupted numerous times by children being obnoxiously loud and disrespectful in a restaurant. My mother asked their server if she would ask the parents to tell the children to quiet their voices as there are other families in the restaurant besides them. They later were approached by a male server named Edgar whom was acting as the store manager since he informed them there was NO manager on site for the night. what kind of establishment has no manager on site during dining hours ??? Edgar wasn't much help considering when he was asked by my mother to speak with the parents he said he couldn't do that and that it was a restaurant. In addition he did say my mom could say something to them, however that could have led the situation to end many different ways.

Let me start by saying I LOVE FUZZYS in BRANDON! This Riverview location is a distant eighth cousin of its Brandon store. This place is literally 10 minutes from my house which is why I was so excited when they opened. But holy moly they have disappointed me EVERY SINGLE TIME! 

Today I stood in the to go door for well over 5 minutes when I realized the lady at the to go window was just going to ignore me so I was better off speaking up. When I asked about my order she said they were working on it. That was now 20 minutes ago. I'm not sure why I wasted the time placing a time in the app for the order to be ready because there was no way in the world they planned on having it ready on time. 

What angers me even more is the lack of organization. 

There's a back door to pick up your to go order. No one to greet you. No one to acknowledge you. Just a bookshelf that says ""online pick up, door dash and Uber eats"". Oh and the shelf is empty.

"This place used to be pleasant to come to - friendly employees, great food, clean... It's none of those things anymore. Most of the employees are clearly not properly trained. I used to come here regularly and now maybe once every couple of months. It's been going downhill for a while. Half of the restaurant is people waiting for pick-up orders while one comes out every 5-10 minutes. They are often out of things. I just went tonigh and it was chaos. The young lady at the register had ridiculous acrylic nails (maybe two inch). How can she put on gloves? She offered to drop some chips since the restaurant had none ready. How can she be dropping anything and isn't that a health code violation (those nails in a restaurant handling food). I told her I didn't want to wait. None were cooking.  Why? I'm sure many people are waiting for chips and none are cooking? Don't you just drop and set a timer? It's clear nobody here cares. I was also handed my bag and knew not everything was in it, I had to ask. Where are the managers? It's a shame what has happened here. I would NOT recommend ever placing a pick up order here. It was the same tonight was it was when I was here last about a month ago. Cleaning also seems have been tossed aside.There was one man who got in the line behind us who was sick of waiting for his pick up order so he ordered in person and probably got it an hour quicker which is just SAD. It's clear management/owner doesn't care about these reviews.",-0.7943
"Simple answer: wouldn't recommend spending time or money here. 
I am really an understanding type of customer, I get that many places are understaffed and overworked especially now. We came in around 4 pm and they were on a wait, no problem. 
After sitting everything went downhill, the server brought a pitcher for water, no glasses (we asked for them the next time she came). No real pleasantries or apologetic tone when revisiting the table after fairly long periods of us waiting for service. She brought one drink (pre-made margarita that we watched the bartender mix up a large batch and pour the alcohol/mix back into a jug for quick use later) then forgot 2/3 drinks ordered. 

At this point we debated leaving but decided to stick it out. 
We ordered, they were busy and assuming my short staffed so it took a while but not unbearable. The employees overall didn't really seem to care, it's one thing to be busy but it's another to just lack any hospitality. Kind of is part of the job as a server so it's disappointing especially since I've been a server and have the motto to never tip less than 20%. 

So, maybe they were having a bad day. I won't go back so I wouldn't know for sure. Just hoping others don't have the same bad experience. 
P.s. it is nicely decorated and well kept, food was decent, not authentic or exceedingly bad just not great.",-0.961
"Restaurant was dead on a Friday night. We came in for the weekend from Orlando. Sat at the bar had a margarita (bartender and drink was good) we orders two orders of steak tacos to go and when we got to the hotel the order was wrong! Wrong beans wrong tortillas and one taco short. Being 11pm after the Lightning game we were starving and pissed to say the least. Called the restaurant three times and no one answered which I thought was ridiculous knowing there was maybe 5 people at the restaurant at the time. Disappointed.",-0.9812
"HELLLOOO!!! Is anyone reading these reviews??? Certainly doesn't seem like it!

This has to be hands down the WORST Chipotle restaurant location ever! When my husband and I walked in there was only 1 person in front of us. There was 7 employees behind front counter, 5 of which were off to the side talking and ignoring the guy making the food who seemed new and totally clueless. The entire work are was a complete mess with food all about. The staff was in considerably slow and not paying any attention to customers.  No had any sense of purpose, care or urgency.  Guess this is what happens when you hire a bunch of young adults. They could care less. 

Chipotle management you need to get your head out of the sand. It's just a matter of time before someone gets salmonella!!!",-0.8733
"This is the worst Mexican restaurant I have ever been to. If I could rate them 0 stars I would. The food was not good and the service was horrible. It took forever to be served and then when the food came, it didn't taste good. 

I went with my family and we all got different things so I was able to try several different menu items. NOTHING was good. All the food looked good, it looked fresh, it looked like it was going to be amazing, but it was prepared horribly.

The place is staffed by Mexicans so its really weird that no one there has apparently ever cooked or even eaten Mexican food. Seriously I think it's some white guy in the back that has never cooked Mexican and then he hired a bunch of Mexicans to work out front.

Do not waste your time or money.",-0.9041
"Disappointed in food quality and service. Husband asked for two burritos fried received two small burritos fried that look like two very small soft taco used. Manager says ""oh thats how they normally look"" and walked away. Not let me try again for you or im sorry your disappointed. 

Also, I normally get the chimi in chicken. This also looked very small and always served  with a taco shell of lettuce and cheese salad on a separate plate. Next to my chimi on the same plate was a hard shell with the lettuce on top probably used to fill in the plate space.

 Very unsatisfied customer service and we wont be coming back for a very long time.",-0.7645

"Visiting from Ohio and was looking to get authentic Mexican food. Tacos had no flavor and they were extremely greasy. It was by far the worst taco experience ever. I would've rather had Taco Bell and we all known that's not authentic. (We had steak and chicken taco on the corn shells, which were not cooked!)",-0.7644
"Just wanted to make it known to someone who hopefully cares about what a terrible experience we had on Monday. We moved from the inside to outside because the restaurant smelled so strong of cleaning products. We ordered 2 margaritas and white queso dip to start.. the margaritas had a lime green powdered mix floating around the whole glass with a dried out.. old lime wedge which made them disgusting and not drinkable. The queso had obviously just been microwaved then brought to our table because nobody even stirred it because there was a thick film over the top and burnt cheese around the rim of the bowl. My husbands enchiladas tasted good but the rice and beans were old and reheated one too many times. My fajitas were horrible... barely any meat on the skillet and whatever meat was there was hard as a rock and not edible. Everything I asked for as my fajita toppings came out wrong and they we got charged additionally when the server fixed her mistake and brought me the right toppings. Server didn't care to ask why hardly any food was eaten and why our margaritas were not drank. We finally ordered a beer in hopes of enjoying the weather on the patio... frosty mugs and good beer... until there was black stuff floating around the bottom of my mug. My husband was sick the entire evening through the next morning and had to miss a few hours of work. HORRIBLE experience and nobody cared to make anything right ... as long as they got paid. Restaurant should not even be open for business.",-0.7408
"Not a good experience. The wait staff were oblivious and the food was mediocre to say the least. Sorry never again",-0.2924
"Ugh! This place is dreadful.

The bar is sticky and gross. I think it must have been the bartender's first day - that is the only way I can explain that he seemed completely overwhelmed with only 3 customers at the bar. He did not even know how to change the channel to ESPN.

The margaritas are made with a powdered mix - disgusting and not a real margarita. Beer choices were somewhat limited.

The food is heavy and tasteless. I ordered a chicken burrito, but honestly forgot whether it was chicken or beef as it had zero taste.

I tried it once, and thought they just had a bad day. Now a second time that was worse than the first visit. I will not make that mistake again.",-0.8688

"First off, I am going to say that I am from California and have had amazing burritos, but if it was just about the food I'd give this restaurant a 2 star. The reason why I have given it a one star is because I purchased Guac and sour cream on my burrito, but it was never added and I got it to go. If the food wasn't that great, fine I'd try another item, but if they can't add my guac they've crossed the line.",-0.6032
"Ordered two Tamales. Food was hard as a rock. They brought another one and it tasted like shit and looked like shit. So ended up having soup from the soup and salad bar. Came home and threw up 5 times and got really sick. Don't eat here. Unless you want to end up in the hospital.",-0.7841
"My friends meat was over cooked, refried beans were runny, they messed up my order and forgot to put chicken on my quesadilla so I ended up with a cheese quesadilla, as everyone else said chips and salsa are NOT FREE..

"I took my son son here for lunch today and it was TERRIBLE. The carpeted floors,tables,and silverware were dirty. The menus were sticky. The salsa was bland. I found a toothpick under my flautas on my plate and showed it to the inattentive server, she took the plate away to show it to the cooks and didn't return for 15 min. My son's burrito was filled with shredded chicken that genuinely smelled like vomit. After waiting a long time for the server to come back with the check, we brought it up to the cashier who was drawing on his hand with a pen before looking up and cashing us out. What a disappointment. A waste of time and money!",-0.8139
"We have gone there twice and ordered different items, the food was awful!! I have not had a good server that acted like they really wanted to help... the servers would hang out in the kitchen talking to other servers or on their cell phones, watching a workers kid that's running around, and hanging out talking at the serving station. I don't like having to wait 10 minutes for a bill to only take it to the register for another lady who is preoccupied with the same kid running around and being rude as well.... never did I get a thanks for coming or how was your meal. I will not be returning even if it were free. Very disappointing.",-0.7642
"Miguel's has always been my ""go-to"" place for work lunches, interviews, dates, etc. throughout the 11 years I've been in Tampa....UNTIL TODAY.  On 2/25 at 11:30am, we had a lunch meeting, and the colleague whom I was with received an order that disagreed with an allergy she discreetly disclosed to the server.  Although the server tried to remedy the situation, it became clear that she couldn't do much, so we asked for the manager.  This is when the service recovery failure occurred.  The assistant manager came over and her body language immediately signaled an annoyance while she asked in a demeaning way, ""what seems to be the problem?""  When my colleague explained that the meal was not meeting expectations and that the way it was billed was confusing (and surprisingly expensive just to accommodate an allergy), the assistant manager ROLLED HER EYES!  Yes, rolled her eyes like a middle school child!!!  When my colleague continued to explain her concerns, she again rolled her eyes and interrupted my colleague, ""Please let me explain....""  I could not believe this.   She continued to justify the cost and the way the burrito was made while not listening or caring with our concerns!!!.  ""That's the way we make it when you order it that way.""  HORRIFIC!!  It was our fault!!!  Can you imagine our frustration when this was the manager on-duty doing this??????

Because I love this place so much, I went to ask the hostess if there was another manager on duty.  She responded no, and I told her that that manager had been completely rude and disrespectful to us.  She asked with a frown on her face, pointing to where our table was, ""oh...were you the two sitting over there?""--implying that apparently we were the talk of the staff at the restaurant!  We are far from those patrons you hear about who try to complain their way to a free meal, yet we were instantly classified as such!!!!!!!  At this time, the assistant manager came over, and I told her how rude and disrespectful she had been to my colleague.  She rolled her eyes at me...yes...again!!!  She said, ""I TRIED to explain to your friend that this is how we make burritos...""  I told her that that wasn't the issue...but rather that ""you did not listen to her as indicated by your eye rolling,"" and she rolled her eyes again!  At this point, I just walked away as I told her about her eye-rolling.  What really bothers me is that if this is how management at this restaurant values us customers, then how long will it be before the servers and bartenders do the same.  

I am beyond upset at this because Miguel's has been my favorite Mexican restaurant in Tampa for most of my adult life.  In the past year, I have easily spent $700 alone at this restaurant (I looked up my expenses), and I always had at least an additional friend or colleague with me on each visit.  This incident likely will result in my not returning to this restaurant.  I am really upset and disheartened that this happened.  Until this manager is removed from the restaurant, I will not return, and I will, unfortunately, have to urge my friends and colleagues to also avoid this restaurant.  This woman who is your assistant manager (according to your hostess) has directly resulted in your loss of a loyal customer.",-0.9445
"I really don't know what the hell is wrong with them. I was going once a week, always tipped at least 25% or more for a party of 1 adult and 3 quiet kids. I make sure the table is clear to make everyone's life easy and have been getting shittier service the more I go. I even recommended the place to my friend from work since the margaritas are good and the food is fantastic. For some very strange reason the service really sucks. Sorry, I don't require much, I'm low maintenance, just bring me warm chips(they don't), check to see if anyone needs refills after 10 minutes(they come back 2 minutes then you won't see them for awhile, even when there is literally 4 people in there). I never see management since I've been there which in other restaurants could be annoying when everything is fine and they want to chat you up. Management needs to do some rounding or just watch as people are literally just waiting for someone to refill a drink or request the bill. I'm going on a one year hiatus, the food is that good to give it a chance, but I put a stop watch today and wasted 30 minutes for a refill and a bill. I normally tip 20% plus, today they got 5. Staff needs training, help, guidance, something. It's a shame that a potentially great restaurant has such bad service.",-0.4786
"Absolutely the worst experience! Our server who was also the assistant manager was probably the least intelligent individual I've met in a while. He did not write our order down, it came out completely wrong. We waited over 15 minutes for the order to be semi corrected. When asking for Tabasco sauce I was given, A1, marinara, and also some Vallentinas sauce that was garbage. When asking to speak to the manager I was informed my server was the manager. I paid 70$ for the worst meal and absolutely the worst service.",-0.9652

"If I could give no stars I would. We were there Tuesday November 17, 2015 and paid by CC and left a cash tip. When reviewing the CC statement the next day my account was charged $18.00, when the bill should have only been $10.68. I called my bank first and they said try calling the restaurant first and see if they will fix/resolve this. Well let me tell you, not only did they not resolve it they laughed and hung up. We called back and said this is theft and they said ""Do what you have to do"" and hung up again. Needless to say, we have had to file with the bank to have the charges reversed, bring in our original receipt and the bank also has closed that CC and issued a new...just in case. I know it is only $8.00 but how many others have they done this too!!!

First, they don't give you free chips & salsa like most Mexican places. We ordered the Queso Amarillo - tasted like melted cheese with a spoon of salsa in it. For dinner, I order the grilled fish tacos & my wife ordered the chicken chimichanga. My fish was overcooked & way too dry. My wife's chimichanga was soggy & not crispy like it should have been. The wood was boring, bland, flavorless & of poor quality. With Chipotle & Tijuana Flats right across the street, this place won't last very long with such poor food quality. If I was from Mexico, I would feel insulted. I don't eat at Taco Bell but even their food would probably be better. Skip this place & get a cheaper tastier meal at either Chipotle's or Tijuana Flats. This place isn't worth it at all. It's a complete waste of $, time & food. As the kids say these days #EPICFAIL!",-0.9707
"My husband and I didn't have a good experience during lunch there this past weekend. The food is not authentic. Both our dishes  tasted like it came directly from a can. The waiters did not value dressing clean and presentable. Many of their shirts looked all washed out. The restaurant had some deterioration.

I just jumped out of my seat I grabbed my server and tried to show him but the rat had moved to quickly and he couldn't see it anymore and I just wanted my check so I could go. The server went to the owner and he just acted so nonchalant like it was the usual. Didn't even apologize or say anything to me. I am thoroughly disgusted. Never going back!

"Be extremely careful about this restaurant. Both racist and health code violations.  I witnessed several health code violations that I am reporting to the county health department.  It started when I was ordering chicken wings and wanted to wash my hands.  The bathroom did not have soap so I asked the waitress if they had soap and she said they would get soap dispenser filled.  I asked her if she had hand disinfectant since it would be a while to get the kitchen people to fill the soap dispensers.  She asked me if I wanted to wash my hands in the employee sink that was right by door.  I told her thank you and began to wash my hands.  then almost immediately I was verbally assaulted by the kitchen manager who told me to get out of the kitchen.  I told him the waitress told me to wash my hands there and he yelled I don't care and was right in my face.  I am Mexican American and it was obvious that he was racist the way he looked at me and approached me.  I understand this behavior well since I run the state's largest economic civil rights organization.  I then asked the bartender to get manager and she told me no.  I then asked her politely again to get manager and she told me she knows who I am and said the manager was not it.  I asked her again and she said she would ask him if he wanted to talk to me and told me he will not want to talk to me.  she went into the kitchen and came back and said manager is too busy to talk to me.  These are thugs and racist who work at Sea Dog Cantina and it looks like the owner/manager is leading this pack of thugs.  So beware of this place...all I wanted to do is wash my hands and what I got was the most racist attack I have ever witnessed.",-0.9762

The filling in the enchiladas are not suppose to have any tomatoes in it at all,  next, the enchiladas are supposed to be baked with a red or green sauce with cheese on top, none of which happened.  The Spanish rice was hard and tasted like uncle Bens instant rice with a dash of coloring, horrible! Not fit for human consumption.",-0.0793

"I work for a South Tampa company and I contacted Miguel's to bring in lunch for 80 people. I left a message for a manager on Tuesday morning stating I wanted to order for 80. On Wednesday morning I had to call back as no had contacted me. I spoke to the Manager Angela Funk. I ordered my items and asked her if I had enough food to feed 80 people. She said ""yes, more than enough"". They delivered a few minutes early which was great. Delivery guy was very friendly and sweet. He set up the table and gave me the receipt to sign. As he was setting up the table I commented that I didn't think we had enough food. He told me to call the restaurant if that was the case. I went to sign the receipt and noticed 2 misc. charges. One was for $25.00 and one for $45.00. I asked him what they were for. His response: The $25.00 is the house charge and the $45.00 is my tip. I was very shocked to find that he drove a mile and made $45.00. I'm definitely reconsidering my position here. Anyway, lunch was very tasty but as I had guessed only half of my company ate. I called the restaurant and asked for Angela, I expressed my concerns for the lack of food and all she said was ""wow, really?"". I said ""yes, and Justin told me to call"" She said ""wow, I'm just so shocked"". I was taken aback because I'm never one to ask for anything and it didn't seem that this woman had any intention of helping me so I just hung up. I am extremely disappointed and won't be ordering from them again.",-0.2282

While she was working on it, another employee came over and instead of taking my order took another online order with 2 bowls and a burrito. I waited approximately 10 minutes just for these orders to be taken. I was appalled that no one could take my order while these were being made, especially since I overheard an employee say they weren't needed to be made for another 20 minutes.

"Ugh.  Stay away.

Went in with my three friends on a Saturday around noon when very few customers were present, and we all had a very disappointing experience.  We universally found the food bland, poorly prepared, and not received as we had ordered them.  One of the greatest complaints was that all of our food was lacking ANY seasoning at all.  It looked rather nice on the plates as it came out... but had far less flavor than they appeared.

My food was the worst, specifically because of two problems.  You have to understand, I HATE mayonnaise and sour cream.  I decided to try the Burrito Loco - the idea of a beer battered burrito sounded interesting.  The waitress was even considerate when I asked if I could have it with a different protein as I didn't feel like either ground beef or chicken, and I asked for shrimp but with no sour cream.  When I got my food, I found this ""chipotle sauce"" was built off of a mayo base, and that they had included sour cream despite my request to the contrary.  Even though there being few customers present, the food took quite some time to arrive so I decided to just eat my food.  It was so bland, but the flavors of the sour cream and mayonnaise OVERWHELMED everything else.  I couldn't even finish it.  Not only that, but the shrimp were under cooked - not raw, but definitely not that proper firmness that left them to detract from the overall texture.

The server, while pleasant, didn't double check on us after delivering the meal until we were two-thirds finished.  They mostly seemed to spend their time congregating at the front counter with one another, even though it was nearly one party per server.

Do yourself a favor... go anywhere else.",-0.7094
"One star is giving this place too much credit. The server we had was good and he was very attentive. HOWEVER, the food was horribly bland and the chips and salsa are not complimentary. The chips and salsa you have to pay for don't even taste worthy of being paid for. Will not be returning here and would never recommend this place to my worst enemy.",-0.8866
"This place is like a fast food place with servers (barely servers as they take your order brig your drinks then walk past you the rest of the time). The hostess didn't even have an expected wait time..The food was not good and the dessert was a disaster. I ended up getting every sick for the food later; over all I would to recommend this place to anyone.",-0.7009
"The service was sooo poor, I feel like writing a long explanation of why is giving this place too much attention. We seen our server when she took our order and when she refilled one drink. Then she pulled ninja magic and we didn't see her again until we flagged her down for the check. I ordered a Pepsi...20mins later I was forced to drink water as the ice from my Pepsi melted. Never did get a refill. Food wasn't great, but not worth the money or the terrible wait.",-0.8358
"Just stopped here for lunch - a quesadilla with picadillo. Staff busy on their cell phones was the first bad sign. Quesadilla almost flat - where's the fill?

"This restaurant is convenient, and the food is cheap. Unfortunately the food is greasy and bad, and the service is terrible. 

We waited for more than 45 minutes for our order which from the exasperated look of some of our fellow patrons was about par for the course. I think that this place is always crowded not because they're popular, but because it takes so long to get your food. 

As hungry as we were, the food was NOT worth the wait. We should have known by the flourescent tennis-ball-green fake 'guacamole' and cut our losses.  By then we feeling were too apathetic.

The fajitas were tough and leathery, the vegetables greasy and bland. The rice and accompanying beans tasted like either a frozen mexican TV dinner, or the inside of a can, I couldn't decide which.

The only thing this place has going for it is that it's not the worst Mexican restaurant in town, but very close.",-0.9189

After trying it, re-trying and continuing to try it we have found the service lacking, our orders are always messed up (i.e. I get cheese on my no-cheese, vegan burritos, etc.), the taste somewhat...off?, and the overall experience getting worse with each visit.

After taking two bites we sent it back and were only offered a 50% discount on the order, when we asked for a full refund, the manager came out and started arguing with us, worst food and dining experience we've had in a while but don't worry, by the time you read this review, I bet this place will have closed down.",-0.3631

Waitress was excellent but the food was just horrid. No taste, no seasonings, nothing. It was so bland and not worth the money spent there.

We got the beef fajitas, ginormous burrito, and chicken dinner. While we were waiting for the food, which on a Thursday night it wasn't busy but our food came out late for whatever reason, so they stuffed us with chips and salsa so by the time we got our food, we barely even touched it because we were almost full. Then when we did touch our food, it was bland.

Just not a good experience and I don't plan on going back ever. To each their own.",-0.8642
"The Tea was great!!!! 
This place is overpriced and the food is like a fast food drive in.  The food was brought out less than five minutes so which indicates nothing is fresh.  I ordered the cheese enchiladas the basic of all Mexican food and I nearly choked on the cheese!!! It was hard and greasy!!! I wasn't sure what they meant by Chile con Crap! so i ordered on the side. It looked like wet dog food warmed up out of can!!
I advised them to take it away immediately.  They still charge me for it.  

Good thing I don't live far because a restroom was needed shortly after leaving.. 

Never ever will i eat here again!!!!!",-0.2942

Tasted like one of thoose microwave burritos you get at the supermarket. I was soggy and tasted like it had been reheated. I had to return my dinner and I dont know what plate tasted worst! I went with my boyfriend he never complains about food he can eat anything you put on his plate. Our server brought our check and I was still having my ""dinner"". He didnt even offer a second round of drinks. It was not like they had a waiting list. There were over 10 empty tables on a Friday night! Hmm that tells you everything.  The mariachis sing great but they were not singing mexican music (something you would expect at a Mexican restaurant).  I can keep on going on how much I disliked this place and will never come back.

They offered to make me a new bowl without the guac, if I didn't want to pay for it. Just really poor customer service. They weren't willing to go the extra mile.

Me attempting to place my order didn't fare much better treatment. Fast forward to today, same guy and while my ordering experience went smoother I made the mistake of ordering my food to go. BIG mistake, when the food was ready ""3 tacos with cabbage lettuce AND guac"" the guy LITTERALLY tipped my entire plate to the side when putting the to go box in the bag. As you can imagine when I opened the box my toppings were ALL over the place. I'm at the counter trying to re-construct my tacos when they guy asks me what's wrong, I let him know that he inadvertently tossed all my toppings around when he tipped the to go box on its side. The guy literally says ""oh."" AND WALKS AWAY. I won't be back to this location. Hopefully the other locations have better service because the tacos are actually pretty decent when they actually resemble tacos and not a pile of slop in a box.",-0.8924

Didn't ask if there was any changes to my food or anything.the guy working said they didn't do beef and I said I paid for it. the manager came and said ""what's the issue"" like it was my fault.

"This was the single worst restaurant experience ever.  

Restaurant atmosphere:   If you are going to have glass tabletops, what you look at through the glass should be clean. It wasn't.  Not only was the table not clean but nothing else was very clean either.  Many of the ceiling tiles looked to be ready to collapse onto the floor at any moment.  The rest of them had significant staining which appeared to be from water damage.  The return air vents were either covered with black as night dust or that was black mold (not really sure).  One of the so called chefs were eating behind the pass.  There were flies buzzing around the whole time.   My five year old was smart enough to not eat the included salad bar after seeing flies on it.  

Food:  chips and salsa.  Chips were warm and crunchy and the salsa was fine. Nothing special but passable. The rest of the food was just plain gross. Period. I got the enchiladas supreme.  Upon inspection of the dish there appeared to be water at the bottom of the plate.  I tipped the plate into and empty salsa dish. The water almost completely filled the dish. The food was soggy and disgusting.  The meat I tried from the enchilada had absolutely no flavor.  Most if the others in my party also had no better luck.  I took a bite of my wife's burrito and there was a hair in the meat.  I returned my dish after a few bites.  They did comp it and offered to get me something else.  I was just no longer comfortable eating anything else with how dirty everything was that I could see and wondered how bad was what I couldn't see.

"There were 3 of us that attempted to have dinner there tonight. The place MAYBE had 10 tables of customers so it was NOT busy. We were the only people that was at the hostess stand needing to be seated. We asked for a booth instead of a table and she said it would be a wait as they didn't have any booths available. A quick scan around the joint turned up at least 2 booths that were empty.  She said we would need to wait as they were wet. The hostess was obviously a poor representation of this place as we had been there before and we never had a problem before. After arguing with her we left and went to Pablano's on Lumsden and walked in and was seated promptly without and confrontation and the food was so much better than Tres Amigos ever was. Guess we won't be going back to Tired Amigos any time soon! My only regret is we didn't ask to speak to the manager...good customer service could have save a sale and a frequent customer.",-0.5096
"Okay, so here's the deal. My girlfriend and I stopped by this place for lunch today... I had been once or twice and she wanted to try the food. We ordered around 1:20 and patiently waited for our food. After a while, we noticed that everyone who ordered after us starting receiving their food. My girlfriend pleasantly asked the guy who was taking orders what was taking so long.. he said that the food was being prepared and ""it should not be too much longer."" We kept waiting and realized that even more people who showed up nearly 20-30 minutes after us were enjoying their food. We became a little more perturbed and kept waiting. By this time, it was nearly 2:00. Finally, my girlfriend asked what was taking so long. Turns out... they lost our ticket. Now, this was 1 hour and 20 minutes after we placed our orders.

The manager apologized and let us know that they would prepare it as soon as possible. It was ready nearly 20-30 minutes after that. As we got our food, my girlfriend asked if she could get her money back. The manager quickly responded that she could not. He said, ""No ma'am you got your food."" Mind you, by this time we were there for nearly one hour and forty minutes. She then said, ""dude, you guys lost my order and you can't give me a refund, why?"" The Manager, who is by the way a giant asshole, said that we got our food so we didn't get our money back and added that he previously said we could get either the food or the money.
By this time, we are both irate. How could someone who works in the food/ service industry treat their customers like pieces of shit? We had a valid point that was quickly dismissed by someone who is providing a service that we are paying for. How could this be? The guy that owns this place does not care about his customers.... his 'place' got on a t.v. show so that gives him the right to be a complete asshole. I am never visiting this place again and I'll be sure to tell every single person I know what a piece of crap this place really is.

"Ate here for the first time for lunch and tried the buffet since the price seemed good. Bad idea. The food was practically inedible. I myself am Spanish and let me say that this food is far from authentic. The food was stale and had clearly been sitting out for quite some time, it was bland or smothered in a sauce for ""flavor."" The enchiladas were barely stuffed with anything, the quesadillas were hard as a rock and I didn't trust the rubbery mushrooms inside, the other items were fried to a crisp or cooked till the cheese was burned or the taco shell was hard. I didn't even want to try the desserts which looked to be either too hard or formed into a pile of gelatinous material. Definitely will never return here.",-0.3013
"I'm unable to rate them -5 stars. 

I ordered their food through Take out Butler my family and I could enjoy a rainy day lazy dinner. Excited to try a new mexican restaurant, we started digging into our food. My husband notices a hair in his food. Short and black.  He picks it out, and eats around that area...finds another one..throws away his dinner. I give him mine, he is eating...finds another hair!!! We grab my sons quesadillas to search for hair, and what do you know, another one.

I feel the need to call the restaurant and give them a heads up as to what happened so that the manager can check the kitchen staff and see what is going on. Joe, the manager picked up the phone and I filled him in. I was extremely polite about the whole thing, and he immediately was on the defensive. He basically called me a liar and said that there was no possible way it could've happened.

Ate there around 4pm and hardly anyone was there (which is understandable since dinner rush probably would start until later) and the table and menus had food and salsa on them.  Very disappointing.",-0.8687
"Overhyped; food is mediocre at best. My boyfriend and I went here today for the first time since all we heard were raves. I ordered a quesadilla with pollo verde; he ordered a burrito penado with the same filling.

My quesadilla was bland and flavorless. They served it to me without it being cut first, so I had to eat it with a knife and a fork because picking it up was impossible; the tortilla was too flimsy. It also had the least amount of cheese I have ever seen on a quesadilla. They put maybe a 1/4 cup of cheese on the entire thing, and it was completely tasteless. The chicken was nice and tender but this green sauce that they spoke of was barely there. Underseasoned to the max. Edible, surely, but not good.

His burrito was drowning in cilantro. It was awful and overpowering. The taste of everything else was 100% 'meh'. The burrito was a decent size but when you may as well be chewing on wallpaper for all the taste you get, it's not really worth it.

The prices are way too high. We paid $18.00 for the two of us and that was with a USF discount. I should've had leftovers for what I paid, and I didn't.

The wait was ridiculous for a place that wasn't even busy--fifteen minutes! There was one person ahead of us and that was it. I'm glad I wasn't in a hurry because these cooks sure aren't.

The bathrooms were clean, I'll give it that. But when we got there all the tables spare one were dirty. It wasn't until we'd been sitting down a good five minutes that someone came and wiped them off, and I think that was only because someone complained.

I became very ill after eating here, although my boyfriend seems to be okay. Maybe it was just bad luck on my part. Maybe the original Taco Bus is better; I don't know.

I miss the Taqueria Monterrey that used to be here; they had much better food, although they had anemic service.

Too long; didn't read:

PROS:

Clean bathrooms
Discount for USF students
Chicken was tender

CONS:

Extremely bland food
Stingy with cheese, particularly on quesadilla
Long wait, even if not busy
Pricy for a taco joint
Dirty tables

"Ugh!  Another frustrating experience with this place. Their food used to be really good, good enough to put up with messed up orders most of the time. But not anymore. Not too long ago they put meat in a vegetarian enchilada and then this time the chimichanga was made wrong and our mushroom quesadilla HAD NO MUSHROOMS in it. And everyone knows how they love to get home get ready to eat and then find out their order was screwed up. Well we have learned our final lesson. Not again. Tomorrow we are going to get our money back for at the least the quesadilla.",-0.3179

Never did get them. The margarita was horrible and they didn't have a blender to make it frozen. Although they advertised frozen margarita. The sliders my son ordered were so raw they were still bloody. The server brought our drinks after our meal arrived. Said the bar was backed up. Sure it was. I ordered fajitas and was only given two tortillas. When I asked for more I waited another fifteen minutes. So in conclusion..... Horrible service, warm water in shot glasses, raw sliders, crappy margaritas .... This place sucks.",-0.9399

"Miguel's has been my my favorite spot for work lunches and happy hour since I moved to tampa several years ago. On Wednesday 2/25/15, at lunch, a breathtaking amount of rudeness and disrespect by an assistant manager made it abundantly clear how little Miguel's values their customers' satisfaction. 

What started the whole ball rolling was a relatively minor issue with my food. I ordered a steak burrito with beans and cheese. I asked the waitress if there were any vegetables including onions in the burrito (I'm allergic); she responded with no, only steak, beans, and cheese in the burrito. Burrito comes out smothered in queso with onions and red peppers cooked into it. In the interest of time I scrape the queso off and start eating the burrito. When I start eating, it's all beans and steak, no cheese; I assumed it was melted down. I get halfway through the burrito and find ALL the cheese congealed in one end of the burrito. I stop eating the burrito because of who wants to eat a big pile of partially melted cheese? When I get the bill, my burrito was rung up differently than expected. Since the burrito was rung up differently than I expected and I hadn't been able to eat over half of it I asked to speak the manager. This is where the real problem started. 

When she approaches the table the first words out of her mouth are ""what is the problem?"" While I explain my dissatisfaction she interrupts me repeatedly to say ""you don't understand, that's how we make our burritos"" and ROLLS HER EYES at me!!! After another 5 minutes of telling me I don't understand, interrupting me, and rolling her eyes, she agrees to take the burrito off my check. 

When she bring back my card and receipt (she still charged me for a $3 soft drink that never got refilled once) she threw it in the table and stalks away without a word.
At this point the colleague I was eating with got up to inquire at the hostess stand if there is another manager available. The rude assistant manager begins to tell him that ""your friend doesn't understand"" and ROLLS HER EYES at him too!! At no point in our interactions with the assistant manager did  anything resembling an acknowledgement that my food was less than satisfactory come out of her mouth. 

Later in the day I called Miguel's hoping to speak to the GM or another leader. I spoke with a man who introduced himself as the owner's son. His reply to my issues with my food was that I ""did not understand how they made burritos"" and insinuated that perhaps our behavior had justified the assistant manager's disrespect. He also said he trusted the assistant manager completely, and would have to watch the cc video to ""see what really happened"" and he would get back with me, but that there wasn't much he was willing to do. 

It's been 3 days since I talked to the owner's son and he has not contacted me to offer any sort of service recovery or an apology for the terrible terrible service and lousy food. 

To recap:
1. Specific menu questions to the waitress were incorrectly answered.

2. My food was executed poorly. Only half was edible, and it was not as I expected it to be.

3. The assistant manager provided a textbook example of how NOT to do customer service or service recovery. She couldn't have been ruder if she tried.

4. The owner's son insinuated her rudeness and disrespect could have been justified and implied he didn't believe/care that our experience at his family's restaurant had been so awful. He also has not kept his commitment to follow up with a dissatisfied formerly loyal customer.

So save yourself the time, money, and frustration and stay away from Miguel's. Instead, try Chihuahua's or Catrina's Cocina on S MacDill or Vallarta's in Carrollwood. You won't be missing anything special.",-0.9251
"I walked into this Tijuana just to get a drink because I work in the same plaza. I noticed the guy who took my order was the manager, he didn't greet me or anything and just took my order.. mid way while I was talking he noticed a customer coming toward him unsatisfied with her food..  he cut me off and grabbed her food and talked to her and came back and rolled his eyes. he handed the food to an employee and was angry with them. then after he took my order again and I told him I just wanted a small Coke he said ""THATS IT?"" in a rude way. then I said yeah and he grabbed my card from me. never again will I come here.. I don't enjoy the food in the first place and nor will I come for a drink or some chips for a snack at work! Manage needs to get it together!",-0.9197
"Welcome to NOEs! Bad attitude paired with skimp portions. This is the only time I went to moe's and left hungry,  my wife asked for a side of olives for our daughters meal and you would has thought we asked for a free meal.

"This is the worst Chipotle experience I've ever had. After pulling a plastic lid from the beans like a grouse magic show the lady making my burrito proceeded to make the worst proportioned burrito with a tortilla that was over warmed to the point where it broke apart on contact. But it didn't stop there, the Chipotle lady told my wife that sofritas didn't have soy. This is amazing to me that the person making our food didn't even know what one of the main proteins were. I could only imagine if someone had a soy allergy. They also forgot my wife's dressing. Shame.",-0.0818
"Ordered a takeout for 6 people  one person only eats cheese quesadillas.  Your cook gave him tortillas folded an cut but absolutely no cheese. Hire some cooks that can read!  Every time we have take out here there is something wrong   With the order but this tine you outdid yourselves.",-0.8493

"I ordered sofritas, they gave me chorizo by accident. I AM ALLERGIC TO MUSTARD SEED AND PORK. I always felt safe with Chipotle but now I just feel very upset and personally violated. I ordered to go, and my food was topped with guac and an obscene amount of lettuce so I wasn't able to double check before eating and trusted Chipotle to do their part. Part of me wonders if they were aware of their mix up and just tried to cover it with the lettuce. You dropped the ball Chipotle and now I'm paying for it!",-0.9161
"I had a really awful experience, my food came burnt, so over cooked that my food was BLACK!  If this wasn't enough my friend ordered the shrimp tacos and one of his tacos came with two  pieces of shrimp The size of a nickels. Over all it was an awfu experience. Everything took an  obnoxious amount of time. We waited so long for our food, and checks. over all it was not a good experience. Not happy at all and will not be coming back.",-0.9276
"Bland. Awful. I felt compelled to write the review at the table before leaving - that's how bad it was. Chips - Stale. Salsa - crushed tomatoes with no spice. Fajitas - no flavor, meat over-cooked. Tacos were a joke. Ordered a tequila on the list (Patron Roca) and they brought Patron Silver as a substitute - that is not OK. Service was slow and the server was obviously over-worked. We will not return.",-0.9141
"Me and my coworkers first time ever at a Taco Bus. Terrible service. Waited 5 minutes for the girl at the counter to even turn around and acknowledge we were there even after we rang the bell. She just sat there trying to fix an iPad. Not welcoming. We finally got to order and the drink machine was out of most options. She wouldn't let me order queso with my combo even for an upcharge. And she was quiet and rude. She didn't explain anything we needed to do just threw the buzzers on the counter. The best customer service came from the cook in the back asking us if we had been helped yet since we were waiting for so long. Never coming to this Taco Bus again.",-0.5116
"Service is terrible.  They got my order wrong and I caught it and told me that I ordered it wrong.  Then when asking to refund the difference they gave me less then what I was owed and argued with me that I was wrong.  Finally after the manager decided to ring it up on the computer she realized I was right.  Both the cashier and the manager were very rude.  I also witnessed the cashier argue with another guest saying that they didn't tell her he wanted something.  Clearly they do not have any desire to provide excellent costumer service.  From what I see it starts with the management.",-0.9377

Then after I asked her for some water for my dogs, I got a new waitress who was as dull as a nail and was not polite or nice. She didn't have a smile or good hospitality. She pretty much gave us our food and didn't say a word. I had to ask her for a refill. But she was very nice to the party next to us so I was uncertain as to why she was not friendly to us. Their Buffalo shrimp is disgusting. I love Buffalo sauce on everything and their sauce tasted like watered down ketchup with a hint of tobasco. If I could give half a star, I would.",-0.7541

"Ordered the chicken tacos. Terrible. Served with huge chucks of tomatoes. A massive amount of lettuce and cheese. Filled with an enormous about of bland chicken.

"Food and atmosphere was terrible! We ordered the fajitas with cilantro rice and refried beans (and avocado we never got). The food had no flavor, the shrimp was under cooked and chewy, the steak tasted like a microwaved roast, the beans were crunchy and from a can, and the rice was plain white rice with cilantro leaves. It literally seems like the owner spent a couple hundred bucks on decorations, bought some microwaveable ingredients to serve, and dropped a bunch of high school students to cook/serve/manage the place!",-0.2225

"This Chipotle must exist in an alternate universe because the food is terrible, the service is laughably bad, and the overall design of the space screams boring.

The employees behind the counter seem as if only their mommies put food on their plates. I had to repeat myself multiple times, ask for more because what was put in the bowl was a speck of rice and a couple of individual beans. And if you're ordering more than one thing they seem to get flustered.

And then the taste of the food -- plastic rice, flavorless meat, bland guac. One visit they completely forgot to place the chips I ordered in my bag. 

Out of three visits I must say that this place is broken. Don't bother trying it for yourself.",-0.8993
"The service at this restaurant is horrible the waitstaff is more concerned about getting back to their back booth and talking to each other than waiting on you or getting you what you need. I've had multiple waitresses give me a disgusting look or be put off by the fact that I ask for another glass of water The food is mediocre at best very Americanized Mexican but the service just totally takes away from the whole experience I'd be surprised if this place is in business a year from now.  The manager and or owner stand at the bar and get people dirty looks continuously I don't understand why they're in this business when they can't even conceptualize what customer service is.",-0.5187
"HAVING TO REDO THIS REVIEW BUT IN SHORT DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME..APPARENTLY I was not descriptive enough SO. The salsa has no taste, no flavor no nothing it was like it look like salsa but tasted like absolutely  nothing. It did not come with my meal I had to pay for it! Unlike most Mexican restaurants and even when I do pay it so good I probably wouldn't care but I should have asked for my money back! The tacos took over 45minutes to and hour to come out I don't know why because it was NOT good was NOT fresh was NOT seasoned the meat was chewy again it look like ground beef but tasted like nothing. I make better tacos at home. the service was entirely to slow my waitress answered with ""ummm let me ask for you"" to everyone question I ask"" She forgot my drink thank goodness I ask for water at the beginning the whole night and at the end I had to get up to leave because she didn't come back I waited waited to send the food back or tell her can they remake it.

"NEW OWNERS AND A POOR PRODUCT!!!! After having great tacos last year at this location, a friend and I looked very forward to returning as we were back in the area.  Sadly, a total disappointment!  Although we had each purchased groupons separately, as we approached the window, the young woman working tried to tell us we could not both use our groupons!  After patiently and repeatedly telling the employee that these were two separate groupons several times, she finally agreed to let us use them.  Between the two of us we ordered 8 tacos, a mixture of carnitas (shredded pork) chorizo/shrimp, ground beef and skirt steak ( carne asada).  We were told that this year, would have to pay 1.00 per taco for cheese and sour cream???  Lousy policy.  Worst part was when we opened our orders at home, all the tacos had NO SAUCE, ( we ordered mild and medium) and were dry and almost impossible to choke down.  Sad, because there was potential - the carnitas were very good and plentiful, the chorizo and the ground beef were seasoned well.  Skirt steak was burnt and not seasoned at all.  We won't be returning and after reading the recent reviews, it seems the new owners need a reboot.",-0.9452

"I hate writing one star reviews. It doesn't happen often. 

I work in Brandon and I've tried pretty much every Mexican place in town without much luck. This was the last place on my list and it was flat out not good.

The positives:
The interior of the place was nice and looked clean. There were a few flat screens as well.

The negatives:
The staff was flat out rude. No smiles. No welcome. No goodbye. No thank you. Nothing. My server stopped by after I was done eating (and I did have a question for her). The food came out 3 minutes after I ordered which isn't a good sign. I ordered the taco, burrito, and chalupa lunch special. The taco was good, the burrito was soggy, and the chalupa....well, here's the question I had for the server. My chalupa was a flat hard shell tortilla, lettuce, and a couple tomatoes. Is that it? I've never seen such a plain chalupa before. 

The food was all luke warm, tasted microwaved, and the beef was probably the lowest quality you could get. Server dropped check off, not a word. I brought to the front. Not a word from the host. Nothing. It was uncomfortable how stuffy it was in there. It's too bad the food was just as terrible.",-0.8665
"I frequent this Taco Bell 3-4 times a week. About every fifth time they screw up my order. This evening was especially bad. I ordered a couple meals including two spicy potato soft tacos without lettuce. When I got to the window in the drive through they did not give me a receipt, neglected to give me the sauce I asked for, and when I got my order I got two tacos with lettuce on them. Sure, mistakes happen. So I went back and asked for them to remake them. When I got the remakes and looked at them it was like they just hand picked the lettuce off of them! Lettuce pieces throughout the cheese and potatoes. Not something that could have easily been explained by lettuce getting mixed in the cheese. Horrible experience.",-0.6689

"So I was in the mood to try something different, and I have seen their ads on Dale Mabry for their lunch buffet. So I say what the hell, I'll try it. I walk in and I am about to be seated, when I tell the server, I would like the lunch buffet. He tells me that the buffet ends at 2pm. It is now 2:06 and I look over and the buffet is full of food in which people are still eating. I look at him dumbfounded, I just made a special trip and I don't know about you...but I consider a little after two still lunch. So instead of giving a customer what he came for, you're going to throw all that food away or worse wrap it up and serve it the next day. Keep in mind, their ads never mention the hours of service.  So I left.. Being angry, I called the restaurant and talked to the manager and only got a weak half apology and no effort to correct the situation.. So I took my business to Chipotle....",-0.8979
"This is the worst mexican food I have ever had. The quality of this food is near Taco Bell's, if not worse. It is over priced and tastes very processed. Their margaritas are made from a premixed (made by some company, bottled and then shipped to their restaurant) mixer. Really?!? How can you call yourself fresh? At one point many years ago when I ate here, the food was excellent. I am not sure if they have a new head chef or new owners, but the food defiantly is not worth a penny.",-0.2698

When I start eating it there is very little meat in it. I've lived in San Diego for 5 years and know what a real Cali burrito is a ton of meat. Fries, cheese, sour cream and pico de galo. I was very surprised that it had lettuce or cabbage in it which seemed really weird I dunno if its just added to make it more of a bigger burrito. I'm just very disappointed.",-0.4927

"I literally just walked out of this place tonight without even eating. Once seated and ordered, we decided to wait at least one hour before asking our waiter how much longer the food was going to be. He said he expected another 25 mins. When we asked to speak with the manager, she said she really couldn't give us an estimate. They also ran out of tamales and pork...really? On a Saturday night? They are clearly unprepared to handle business in this area. The manager asked what she could do to make us happy, but at that point we really could not wait any longer as we had young children with us who were very hungry, as well as ourselves! I do not recommend this place. In my opinion, I found it very unprofessional that the manager didn't come to each of the tables still waiting on food (as there were multiple tables in addition to ours that were still empty and waiting on food) to inform us of the situation, rather than us having to reach out to the manger to ask what's taking so long. I really have no incentive to return here.",-0.5548

Sat in the drive-thru for 12 minutes for two tacos and then ask for hot sauce while a girl who's working the drive-thru with bright green artificial nails puts her fingers in her mouth and then handis out the sauce with the hand that she put fingers in the mouth. Just disgusting!",-0.5067
"Horrible. As in shockingly so. Paid for chips and salsa and the chips were stale. The salsa tasted like El Paso. The taco had Taco Bell type meat only Taco Bell is much better sadly. We waited forever for our order even though it was slow there that day. Then two entrees came out wrong. Same thing happened to the table next to us.

Took 45 minutes to seat us. Took another hour to get food. Food was gross- flavorless, frozen then reheated...just gross. The chips and salsa was the only good thing about this place, but with our large party, they gave us 4 cereal sized bowls of chips and 4 tiny cat saucers of salsa. 
My expectations were low to begin with...my experience just blew them into a black hole.",-0.5732

"Super unhappy with Saturday service. I always go to this restaurant for Mexican food it was one of my favorites and I go here quite frequently. However with the attitude I received tonight from the bald built guy who I believe seemed to be a manager has me debating if I will ever come back. As a loyal customer who always recommends this place I was treated so rudely. I went in to find the wait which was around 40 mins so I asked if I could have a few mins to debate if I wanted to wait with my aunt for a table and have them put me on the list. After me being hesitant about it the hostess told me I'll let you get a table outside because she knows we come here often and spend a lot money but there was no tables available so they told us go wait for a table outside when the next is available. So we did do just that.. but we waited about 15 mins and then got the table until the rude manager of a guy started saying we couldn't have the table and didn't listen to us or ask us who told us that. The man just said we must of heard wrong and that we would have to wait around 2hrs even longer than before. well that offended me so guess what we left ... and found a New Mexican restaurant BESITO.",-0.8723

I wanted to just walkout after that but figured I had already spend over $30 so I may as well play it out. The food came, and it was awful. I should have just left, I'll leave it at that.

"This place is not good and is definitely not worth what they charge! We had a $70 lunch for 2 adults and 2 kids and my husband and I even shared our food. They serve their fajitas in a ceramic dish and they were cold. We ordered vegetarian fajitas and they serve it with a baked potato, which I found odd, since pretty much every other entree was served with rice and beans. Maybe they cook them in meat, but they should at least give you an option. I now remember why we stopped eating there and will NEVER do it again.

Lame vegetarian options too!!",-0.7151
"Rating 1 star because obviously I have to rate a star to leave a review. I mean come on, ok it's Taco Hell and not the best place to eat however is it that hard to get an order correct AND provide decent customer service!?  I know I'll post this and nothing will be done to fix anything since I've left bad reviews for this location before and we've boycotted for quite some time. This is our first time back in a long time. 

Just me luck that I get the bad experience on a day full of bad experiences lol. Exhausted from work and came here per my daughter idea since she's really the one in the family that prefers TB since we didn't feel like cooking. Drive through took forever as it always seems to do here. And I swear my only poor TB experiences are at THIS LOCATION!  Sat waiting at the window for our order for over 5 minutes!  It's hell getting in and out of this parking lot, get home and all in my comfy pants to enjoy our supposedly quick dinner......open my Mexican pizza and find very little meat (nothing new) I mean you pay $3 for it so yea sure I'll just take a refried bean pizza. My husband ordered the burrito supreme. Opens the wrapper and notices that it's a burrito but it's grilled on the top--the burrito supreme does not look like this. So he bites into it and notices just beef and lettuce, opens it and it only has beef and a little lettuce. Well, back to put on my jeans and off to TB to get our order fixed. Yup, took my Mexican pizza too because why should I have to eat a soggy pizza when I have to run back up to get my husbands burrito corrected!!??  Oh and did I mention that when I originally opened the bag and pulled out the hot sauces they were all sticky and stuck together! How disgusting. Turns me off from wanting to eat actually. Pull in and they aren't busy...walk right up explained the issue to the clerk who looked unimpressed and like he really wanted to be there, all slouched over the counter. Doesn't acknowledge anything I've said. Merely looks towards the back and waves for the manager. Manager comes from the back. She asks what I needed and I explain to her again since the boy didn't do anything but stand there. She took the burrito opened it and tells me that it's a supreme burrito--I told her that it's not, only has beef in it! I then tell her because of the inconvenience I want my pizza remade. She takes the burrito and tosses it in the trash and tosses the pizza on the counter....walks over to the food prep area and tells them to make a pizza and supreme burrito. She then takes the sauces out of my bag and rinses them off in the sink with water, dries them and places them back in the bin of sauces. Now keep in mind that I left with those during my first visit. Those should've gone in the garbage since they left the establishment and it's a food establishment!!  When the food is ready which was no less than 2 minutes she tosses the bag on the counter and asks if I got sauces from the counter. No apology, no sorry about that, no come again, nothing of that sort. I'm just in awe of how this played out.",-0.9352
"Had to return food 4 times back to back, every time there was something they forgot. Total lack of regard or care for the customer. They also got mad at me when I asked them to re prepare my food after they botched my order, not once, not twice, not even three times, 4 times. Terrible service.",-0.6597
"This is the dirtiest place I have ever stepped foot into. I ordered my food, paid 23 dollars for two bowls, looked around as I was getting my drink and almost threw up from how dirty it was.

"Two days ago I ate a chicken burrito with brown rice, lettuce (none Romain), corn, and salsa. 

Yesterday I woke up at 2:30am in a sweat with a massive pain and gurgling in my stomach. Explosive bowl movements ensued that day along with more cold sweats. The next day (today) I woke up with my stomach feeling like it had a ton of rocks weighing it down along with running to the bathroom to throw up while at work downstairs. Of course I called immediately after my managers told me to go home to let the manager at Chipotle know what had happened to me. She informed me that they had gotten their lettuce from a none effect source and to come in afterwards for a refund. 
Personally, of course, I have no way of knowing if the lettuce they brought in was a none effected lettuce since I honestly didn't know there was an outbreak until she told me. For myself I will get my refund and will not be coming here again. Chipotle has made me scared of their food no matter where I get it. I do appreciate the manager informing me on what was going on with the lettuce and such so I do give her credit. 

All in all I would not recommend this location and, personally, any location.",-0.0798
"This place has gone downhill fast.  Use to be great.  Went in a few weeks back and they were out of several items AGAIN.  Ok, it happens.  Today at 1:00PM nobody at window.  I waited 4-5 mins., said ""Hello?"" a few times but nothing.  The side door was open and I thought maybe someone was injured or tied up so I walked inside.  Kitchen and grill top was filthy!  A woman emerged and I asked are you open?  She said yea, as if nothing out of the ordinary.  So I walked back around to the window to place my order but she did not appear.  I waited another minute and gave up.  I will not be going back.  Too bad.  Don't know if it's drugs, apathy, or just bad leadership but this place is off my list.",-0.9209
"Last Sunday I ate lunch at the restaurant.  This place is a disaster in the food preparation area.  I don't know how they can stay open.  I've had good food served at several other Taco Bell's but this place is ridiculous!  This place thinks the only ingredient is refried beans!  Stay away and find another Taco Bell.",-0.6634
"You can't be a hole in the wall and have shitty food. Got to pick one. Some of the worst tacos I've ever had. Everything was dry and bland. They put too much cabbage so it tasted like a nasty chewy salad. Taco Bell would've been more satisfying",-0.7386
"Ok, not sure what's happening here today. First- no greeting as I walk in the door...everyone looking at me like they wish I hadn't come...Then-After I got my food from very unfriendly employees, it turns out it is barely room temperature. 

I'm starving, so I ate it anyway. I really hope I don't die. If I do, tell Nancy Grace that Moe's killed me. Thanks! 


Update 5/2/19 I'm not coming back to this location. Just heard the manager angrily berate an employee in front of a long line of customers. One employee simply points at you when it's your turn, without a word. No greetings, no thank you... Everyone here acts miserable and I don't need this stress during my lunch.",-0.3896
"Horrible service. I ordered food through a delivery service and was missing a burrito bowl. I called an encountered Laura, who is the most disrespectful, unprofessional and has no clue what customer service is. She was unapologetic about HER error and simply stated that she never heard of a Portobello Bowl and essentially disregarded it on my order. Really?? Than why charge me or maybe even call me to say, we don't have this, and offer an alternative. Nope, it would have taken too many brain cells for Laura to use. Furthermore, she couldn't even provide me with a refund because there was no manager? Seriously? What a joke! Don't waste your time or money!",-0.9493
"Some of the worst Mexican food that I have ever had and we eat a lot of Mexican food! We got two chicken tacos and two steak tacos along with a Godzilla  Burrito with steak and shrimp and all of it had no taste. We waited over 15 minutes for them to fix it so we thought it would be hot but when we got it home less than 10 minutes away it was cold. The chips that we ordered and paid extra for were stale and chewy. Queso was not even slightly warm.  Even after hearing everything up, we still couldn't eat it.  Absolutely bland and nasty.  We tossed it all in the garbage. Never again!!",-0.9
"I don't even want to give this location 1 star as it doesn't deserve ANY. This location is the slowest Taco Bell I have ever been too. On average, inside or drivethru will take about the same time which is normally about 20 minutes. The staff often get your order wrong or argue with you about your order when you complain. 
Drinks are often disgusting as they never seem to have their CO2 changed. 
Management seriously needs to get their act together and teach the employees to multitask.",-0.9066
"Was never asked if I wanted an appetizer, never got a refill on my water, didn't offer dessert, didn't have food with good flavor. Honestly all around nothing was satisfying. I should've known from the size of the parking spaces this place would be shit.",-0.0464
"A group of 6 of us went here last night for a birthday dinner. The told us the special was Kobe beef tacos. Three of us got that and they SUCKED! I mean literally garbage. The homemade corn tortillas were soggy and disgusting. The beef portion was so small. The only other thing in the taco was onion and cilantro. Side of beans and rice were small too. My boyfriend ordered the flautas and his order came out about 15 mins later than the rest of our table because the server forgot! He asked how our tacos were and we told him not very good and he could take our plates.... he just said ""oh"" and walked away!!!  He cleared my boyfriends plate (his dinner arrived late) before he was even done eating! Finally, the bill came after we waited for another 20 mins. Come to find out those crappy tacos were $25 a plate! What the hell!!!! Absolute insanity! I'll never go here again!",-0.9444

"This place used to be really good but the quality, cleanliness and service is horrible now!!!  The person taking orders seemed to not know the menu, was disengaged and unfriendly, and messed up our order numerous times even though it was a simple order and we were the only customers in the place. the restaurant and bathrooms were filthy with dead bugs on the floor-- even though it had just opened for a Saturday. I will definitely not be returning to this TacoBus location on Fletcher!!",-0.939

"This place is probably the most nastiest place I've been too. Literally once you enter the store. It has a weird gloomy vibe and the place has 1-2 ppl working. I ordered the chicken burrito and chicken empanadas. The chicken was literally felt it came out of the microwave and the chicken burrito was just a rolled up bland and old refried beans, lettuce, chicken and rice. If your around the area. Highly suggest not trying the overpriced and bland food. Not only that, the food takes forever to get. This location should be shut down or management must do something.",-0.7178

Server never asked if I wanted another drink. Never refilled my water. Never refilled chips basket. Had to wait again for server to bring check.  Would not recommend this place because of such atrocious service.",-0.3858
"I went to this restaurant today. The food was not good at all and they serve a little amount of rice and the tortillas were burned. They served my food in an old plate that looks like dirty.

Bad enough that I made a yelp account.",-0.6369
"This was by far the worst experience I have ever had at any Taco Bell. After waiting in the drive thru an abnormally long amount of time, I ordered two chicken Gordita supremes with no tomatoes and avocado ranch instead of sour cream. When I got home i realized I received chalupas instead. I went back to Taco Bell and told them and they attempted to make me a new one with no more than an insincere apology. They gave me beef Gorditas instead of chicken and inbetween the two was sauce and cheese all over the wrappers that spilled all over me when I took them out of the bag. I returned these while still in the drive thru and told the cashier that they were beef and not chicken as I had ordered. She did not apologize and took the bag and told the cooks to make a new one. I then asked for a cup of water while I was waiting and was given soda water instead. When I finally received my chicken Gorditas I bit into them and realized that the wrong chicken was put on them that was covered in a tomato based sauce which does not normally come on the gorditas. I was too frustrated and far too hungry at this point to wait for another order to be made. This Taco Bell wasted so much of my time, made me 3 wrong orders, and didn't do a single thing to make it right.",-0.9734

"The waitress was nice I give them that , But the food was absolutely disgusting the tortillas tasted like playdough the salsa was watery the chips were eh ok I guess compared to everything else . My soda was absolutely disgusting I'm not sure how you mess that up I asked if I could get a different drink again it was terrible ! I ordered fish tacos honestly the absolute worse taco I've ever consumed in my life the layered nachos compared to the rest was decent enough to eat . And with that I do not recommend this place you are better off going to Taco Bell .",-0.9221
"Please BEWARE OF THIS PLACE!!!! It is very very nice inside...priced well and service isn't bad. However after I was almost done with my meal I was drinking my water from a straw and saw a roach crawling on the rim of my glass. I was sitting at the bar during my lunch. I reacted in a way anyone would who just ate a whole meal only to find a roach crawling on rim of his or her glass. The server then asked what was that and I said it was a roach. She then replied it probably wasnt but ok..let me have your glass. Didn't ask to comp me. I asked for the mgr/owner and she replied he couldn't leave what he was doing to come and talk to me and besides I already paid. So I was really frustrated. I just think she should have done more to accommodate especially after I saw a ROACH LIVE CRAWLING ON MY GLASS I WAS DRINKING FROM. THIS PLACE IS NOT CLEAN AS IT APPEARS. DONT EAT HERE",-0.7676
"Worst customer service gave me the wrong meal and drink, did not notice beacuse i was in a hurry for i was on a lunch break. I've called 9 times over to stress that my order was wrong and the cashier at the drive thru window was not very attentive as i waited maybe 30 seconds and asked receipt, never got it was  . I finally got a call and a lady picked up didn't address her name. I explained my experience and she was quiet only to to repeatedly tell me she is ""sorry about that"" over and over like i was speaking to a machine. She clearly didn't want to help or offer to fix my issue. She did not know how to solve a simple fix and just hung up on me after i said ""you can offer to fix it besides 'i am sorry about that.'""

"This might be the worst chipotle of all time. This is unfortunately the closest location to my house so I've been probably half a dozen times and have had some type of issue EVERY SINGLE TIME!? Anything from undercooked rice, dried out steak, Stale tortillas, No tortillas, no sour cream and even no black beans. I have a cousin who works for corporate chipotle and I do love the chain itself but this store needs a major change in either managing or someone isn't doing a good job. The Last Time I ordered from here I got a bowl that had multiple pieces of foil in it and when I called I wasn't compensated at all. DO NOT GO TO THIS CHIPOTLE.",-0.7815
"I have never experienced such awful and rude customer service before in my life. My friends and I went in on a pretty busy evening, purchased beer and $10 drinks. Upon receiving our $10 drinks, we asked the waitress if there was anything she could do about the drinks because they tasted so terrible we couldn't even take a second sip. After taking 15 minutes to come back to us she suggested putting grenadine in the drink. She took another 10 minutes to get a few cups. When she checked back on us we told her no the drink still tasted pretty bad and was there anyway we could switch it out for their cheapest beer just so we could have something to sip on. She told us that once something was poured she couldn't do anything about it and sent over her ""manager"". Some woman came over to our table very agitated and started speaking down to us and blaming us for ordering grenadine since now there was nothing to do. We calmly explained the situation and how the waitress told us to add the grenadine and all we wanted was something drinkable and would be happy paying $10 for even PBR. After this suggestion, she threw her arms up and very rudely told us ""too bad"" and walked away as we were still trying to speak to her. At this point the waitress came back over to us, apologized and informed us she would cover our bill for such rude service we just received. Later we found out the woman that came over to us was not a manager at all. As we were trying to leave and get our credit card, the owner of the bar was seen taking multiple shots of alcohol, and then confronted one of the members from our party about the situation. He then pushed her into bar stools in an attempt to actually physically push her out of the bar. At this point, our party was still calmly sitting on our seats while the police were called to kick us all out of the establishment.

Never go to this establishment because even the waitress came up afterwards and explained this type of behavior from the ""manager"" and owner were a common occurrence. Not once was there an apology or responsibility taken for their actions. I can't even put in to words how terrible the experience was and how rude the owner and ""manager"" were. The waitress was the only polite person in this situation and ended up getting penalized from the situation due to her  manager and owner.

They're my fav Mex dish ever BUT I literally spit out the tamale I ordered and was VERY disappointed at its flavor and how dreadfully dry it was each time I gave it a chance and sadly disappointed each time. Nowadays, when I'm expected to be at this restaurant for a family gathering, I literally only eat the chips and salsa. I don't even order anymore and I just sit and wait for everyone else to finish. It's a shame. Please comes up with a different system in your kitchen. The food is just not very good",-0.8187

The food was not of Chipotles quality.

The lines were so long and they couldn't tell you a wait time. The young ladies on the bull horn yelling your name was so muffled and loud, you could not understand anything she was saying.

"Friendly staff unless you understand what they're saying. The staff speak amongst themselves in Spanish as if no one can understand what they say and without care of whom they may offend. A group of waiters were ogling girls (even minors) and making inappropriate comments without care of who may overhear them. One older female waitress realized I could understand her coworkers and made an apologetic, shameful expression toward us. On our way out, one of these waiters nudged another as if to say ""look at her"" while staring at my wife. I kept my cool and just told the guy in Spanish ""you should try to be more discrete"" he just stared like an idiot and as I walked out gave his best attempt at a tough-guy comment. I went back in and tried to do the right thing and speak to the owner, who was at the cash register too busy to notice anyone or anything around him. To cut a dragging story short, the owner never acknowledged me and the guy who made the idiot comments (who not surprisingly turns out to be the owner's son) kept staring every time he walked by taunting me, but with the look and stench of fear..... If you are looking for a Mexican restaurant and there are women in your party, go elsewhere.

It took at least 15 mins from seating (by hostess) until waitress even came by our table for a drink order, and chips and salsa came after that;  the waitress didn't even finish listening to our drink order before she ran off while I was trying to order the queso fundido as an appetizer..... Came back 7 mins later with drinks and we finally ordered the queso fundido...she literally ran off ""to start that"" while we were trying to tell her our margaritas had no salt....she came back 10 mins later to take our dinner order.  I ordered the chicken/steak combo fajitas, my daughter ordered the carne asada, chic tacos from kids menu and enchiladas for my husband.  My fajitas had 3 strips of beef and 2 strips of chicken, a tablespoon of rice, a teaspoon of sour cream/quac etc.  Food not even ""tasty"".  Taco Bell is better, cheaper and quicker.  The prices here  are ""low"" compared to other sit-down Mexican style restaurants, but so is quantity/quality/service.  Very disappointed.  We had a coupon for $10 off and it still wasn't worth it.  We won't be back.  So sad.  I give it ""one star"" because of the coupon.",-0.9044
"Food ok. Service not so much. Waiting 15 min for drink order and waiting 30 min for no food... Asking for it to go because we are still waiting while the servers dance...unacceptable. I want to support local places, but this is BS. No more.",-0.2023
"Every time I try to get food here 45 minutes to close  they say their system is down aka they don't wnat to make   Anymore food. It's a fast food joint. That's why people come here.

"Horrible customer service. Staff is rude and unprofessional. It's a shame because the staff were so nice a couple of years ago. I'd give 0 stars if I could. Drive down the street to the other Taco Bell on Fowler if you want to be treated like the paying customer you are and not a burden.",-0.6221
"If you like raw chicken then this is the place for you. Chicken sandwich was raw, asked for it to be recooked and what they did was put the same sandwich, bread and all on the grill. The problem is the raw blood had already soaked into the bread. The ""manager"" was asked to come to the table and was explained to her that just throwing something on the grill is not a resolve to the issue. The ""manager"" asked if she could get us a round of drinks and we agreed. The server came back and said the owner said, ""nothing else can be done, but we will take the sandwich off the tab.""",-0.0366
"Ordered the Parilla Venezolana and it was delicious. BUT ... THE SERVICE WAS HORRIBLE!! 

HORRIBLE! And we ONLY ordered that 1 plate. 

We got to the place at 7:15pm. Didn't get our food until 8:30pm. When we got to the restaurant, we asked how long the wait would be to order to-go and the lady told us 35min. She said it would be quicker if we sat down. WRONG!  The young man (our server) also said it would take 20min for the food to come out when he took our order. It took 50min from the time he took our order.  

We also complained to the manager and he apologized and said he would talk to the lady who we spoke to first. The only they gave us for the inconvenience was a desert. 

Again the flavor of the meats were delicious BUT I DO NOT recommend coming here unless you come an hour before you are hungry. 

Pedí la Parilla Venezolana y estaba delicioso.  PERO ... EL SERVICIO FUE HORRIBLE !!

 ¡HORRIBLE!  Y SOLAMENTE pedimos ese plato.

 Llegamos al lugar a las 7:15 pm.  No recibimos nuestra comida hasta las 8:30 p.m.  Cuando llegamos al restaurante, preguntamos cuánto tiempo sería la espera para pedir para llevar y la señora nos dijo 35 minutos.  Dijo que sería más rápido si nos sentábamos.  ¡INCORRECTO!  El joven (nuestro servidor) también dijo que la comida tardaría 20 minutos en salir cuando tomó nuestro pedido.  Pasaron 50 minutos desde el momento en que tomó nuestro pedido.  

 También nos quejamos con el gerente y él se disculpó y dijo que hablaría con la señora con la que hablamos primero.  Lo único que nos ofrecieron fue un flan. 

 Una vez más, el sabor de las carnes era delicioso PERO NO recomiendo venir aquí a menos que vengas una hora antes de que tengas hambre.",-0.987

"Went here to watch the Mayweather vs McGregor fight because every other place in town was full. My boyfriend told me negative things about this place but we were hungry and really wanted to watch the fight. When we get there they have a man charging us $10 to get in, which is understandable considering so many places were doing the same. When we get in we are given a PAGE of food items that were basically just nachos (and extremely overpriced...13.99 for steak nachos) but again we were hungry so we ordered it. They gave us the plates with NO utensils or napkins and left. The TV was later than the speakers so we heard everything before seeing it. They started playing music which is so dumb to do if people are here to watch a fight. Service was terrible and the quesadilla looked like a horrible uncooked omelette. Would never go to this place again, its a disgrace to the Mexican culture.",-0.9841
"This was very disappointing for a restaurant that is so highly rated. Portions were small, the beef was entirely cartilage and fat, and the owner nickel and dimes you for everything. Sauce, onions, guacamole, water, it all costs extra. There is no indoor dining area and I was vigorously pestered by a disturbing amount of flies around the restaurant. I can make far better tacos at home with side beans and rice for far less than the $12 I paid for this minuscule ""meal."" There were also a lot of trashy people hanging out around the shop not actually dining, and looking for trouble. This last part was expected however given the dumpy location.",-0.8748

Thought we'd give this place another try.  Tables were all dirty even though place only had a few customers.  Server never came back after we received food.  Never offered refills on drinks.  Hubby's tacos were ok.  My meal was edible.",-0.0258

"If you know what Mexican food should taste like, you will be disappointed. If you like receiving bright orange shredded cheese on everything, this is your place. 

I used to like it here but ever since the remodel, it just isn't the same. I went there with a group for someone's birthday lunch and I was shocked. We had five people in the group. Three liked it, and two (who regularly eat in all the Mexican restaurants in town), were disappointed. 

We won't go back. It is just average to below average food.",-0.0644
"It's been a while since I've been here, but was craving a burrito so decided to stop by. The burrito was okay. The side salsa's were at least flavorful.

"Been to this Taco Bell a view times, only late at night through the drive through and EVERY TIME our super simple order is very wrong and usually burnt to a crisp. Normally just shrug our shoulders and laugh, not caring much and say ""ehh you get what you pay for""... by tonight we went back to the window pointing out how they put lettuce on all our tacos when we said ""NO LETTUCE"" and literally all they did was open them and pick some of the lettuce off with their fingers! This had me furious, As I'm sure it would any normal person?! Its not hard to read the simple screen telling you specific directions on how to do your job. I am seriously concerned on the type of people the establishment is hiring for the late night shifts!!!",-0.7028
"If  it was possible to give zero stars I would.  I have eaten at several Vallartas in the area and this one is by far the worst. The service was horrible, the food was messed up and when we pointed out the big chicken bone we had in our enchiladas it was just blown off.  If you're in the area, go down the street, there is a far superior restaurant not far away.",-0.7579
"Very disappointed! First off, the chips were overcooked. You know, when they are that orange color and taste like they have been seating under a heat lamp for a long time. Not a good start. Then I ordered the chicken nachos trying to go the safe route. Bad idea! Same burnt chips with microwaved melted cheese and a few chunks of chicken. I'm not a picky eater at all, but I didn't even finish my meal. On a good note, the prices were reasonable, so I only lost a few dollars!",-0.869
"Placed a pick up order so that we didn't have to wait in line and what not. Ended up waiting at the store any how because they hadn't started our order, ended up being a hour past due by time we finally got our food.

"I really don't know why this place has so many starts. I went here for the first time with my mom on Sunday. First of all we were sat by a young guy. As we got to the table he dropped all the silverware and STILL placed them on our table. We asked for a high chair and he said they didn't have any. We pointed to the back corner and told him those where high chairs and he said oh no we turn those upside down for a baby and we had to tell him if you don't turn it upside down its a ""high chair"" we finally got our high chair and sat at the table for about 20 min or so. A larger group came in and we noticed they got chips and salsa as soon as they sat down. We were there already 20 min and no chips and salsa. We asked our waitress for some chips and salsa and got them 10 min later, by then we already wanted to leave. So the waitress comes over asked if we were ready to order and we asked her if we could sub the meat on the meal menu instead of ground beef could we get shredded beef. She stated they don't carry shredded beef and I pointed out in the menu it stated ""shredded beef"" she said it's the steak. My mom then asked if the menu was wrong. Then she snapped at my mom and told her steak and shredded beef are the SAME!!! How can you have people working at your establishment who don't know what a high chair is or a server who doesn't know your own menu. It's crazy. Now I see why this place is NEVER PACKED. Anyways we ended up sharing the sampler with chicken flitas quesadilla and nachos (5 chips & cheese dip) and a kids chicken finger meal. Our bill was $30 that's ridiculous for 3 people to SHARE a sampler and 1 kids meal. They need to change the prices and the kids meal doesn't include a drink. So you will be charged $2.50 for a kids drink since its regular price. Anyways I wouldn't want to come back and even tho it's so convenient down the street I won't be back. Terrible service. Please hire new people who know the menu and what a high chair is and people who won't snap at your customers over a simple question. If I could I'd give 0 stars but I can't",-0.2832
"These employees are super rude, they rushed us as we tried to order and then didn't even put in half of our order and when getting to the window they wanted to argue and said ""well do you want your food or not"". They then told us that we needed to either go through the drive through line again or come inside if we wanted to order the other half of our order that they didn't ring up. They were completely unprofessional and then didn't give a receipt and stared us down as we drove away. If I could give zero stars I would.",-0.4005
"The positive? 
*My food was delivered quickly. 
*Tacos were stuffed full. 

The negative?
* Despite super-quick delivery my food was cold. 
* There was no flavor to the taco whatsoever EXCEPT for the taste of meat that had gone bad. 
* Salsa literally tasted like tomato water. 

Even after adding Tajin, salt, and the salsa these tacos were bland. 

I was totally disappointed.  Ate one taco and threw the other two away. I was worried about food poisoning. Plus there was no point in wasting something so nasty and unsatisfying. 

I ordered through Grubhub and my total (3 carne asada tacos with cheese, cabbage, cilantro, and pickled onion on soft corn tortillas and one flan) was $29 and some change. This was a waste of money. I will never eat there again.",-0.974
"Absolutely no pride in what they do, no customer service skills.  DO NOT go to this location.  My son and friends ordered food and paid at the kiosk.

She told them to call their bank.  What? No explanation whatsoever.  DO NOT give these people your money.",-0.632
"If I could give 0 stars I would.  I will never eat here again.  The chicken in my salad was burnt. By the time they brought me a new piece (20+ minutes) later I was done with the salad.

I will never eat or drink there again.",-0.4215
"Went here with some friends and it was a fantastic experience.
The next experience was not good. Ordered from the website went to pick it up went back home to realize that stuff was made incorrectly and was missing a quesadilla. I called them and they apologized for the mistake and said they would remake the items. Drove 20 minutes back there for them to not believe that my order was wrong. The lady was refusing to give me the food, I had to ask her multiple times to get the food. Definitely a horrible experience to just get my food I was missing and paid for.",-0.7009

Tasted like left over taco bell. After getting home and going to bed I woke up 6 hours later with the worst food poisoning I've ever experienced. I had no other food after eating there so there's only one option. I'm hugely disappointed.",-0.9514

I ordered the grande burrito maraville for take out due to virus . When I got home and opened the box I was severely disappointed. This burrito is supposed to have chicken, steak , rice and beans , lettuce and cheese plus a sauce on top . What I got was old chewy chicken , beans , and that's about it . It was terrible. I was so glad they were open and making food . I feel cheated for what I paid $14.00 for. You suck Vallartas and so does your food.",-0.9532

I've had service at this facility 5 times before I've decided to mKe this final review. Until this location hires a completely new crew I wouldn't expect anything less than dissatisfaction from this place. If you want the wrong order, burnt, and in 15 minutes or more than this place will deliver 100%. It's incredibly sad to think that it is that hard to make some tacos.",-0.9084
"This is a terrible restaurant.  They messed up my order then demanded I fix it through Uber.  Actually told me I had to fix it through Uber.  They shorted me on food.  Admitted it was their mess up and I am supposed to fix it through someone else? Then the guy says ""he is the owner"" and that's how it's going to be. He actually said that to me.  Unbelievable.   Do any of you really want a food preparer who is willing to steal your money and push off their admitted mistakes on others actually handling your food? That's pretty scary.  I'd beware of this restaurant.

Check out the Angel and Samantha review below.  They are spot on.  Something is very wrong with a restaurant that goes to battle with a customer after they took money and refused to make right their wrong in shorting food.  If they are this greedy and skimping, my concern is the safety of the food preparation quite frankly

So because of this guys outrageous behavior they lost all of my future business and people in my office. I was a good customer.  Does that cover the value of a sandwich? Not good economic sense for the restaurant or putting good will into the community in my opinion especially when I did not get a refund of the money I spent for food not even provided.",-0.9482

"I placed an internet order (so everything is literally spelled out on paper), I get home and every single bowl and burrito are WRONG. WRONG meat, wrong toppings wrong Everything!! Not to mention it was ICE cold. They didn't label a single item, so when I got home after a 5 hour flight I had to undo every singlw burrito to see the inside to know whose it was, to find out everything is wrong, then I had to heat all of it up. When I called, the manager LAUGHED on the phone, said he'd comp one bowl if I came back in and that was it, so $55 down the drain and have to cook dinner for my kids who won't eat the spicy meat that they were given instead of carnitas. And to top it off we had 3 bags of chips so stale they were inedible!!!! I am DISGUSTED by this location, their manager and their awful customer service.akes me say forget IT!",-0.9707

I'm disappointed in my experience as I've never had a restaurant refuse to seat me as any other paying customer.

"Ok not even sure where to start on this one..

Been coming to this place for about 2 years because it's the only place with decently healthy food close to my work at the price. 

It's Chipotle but I would avoid this place at all costs...

- There is a bigger lady that seems to manage the cash register daily and she might be the manager. Anyway. I've watched her cuss at customers, talk bad to other customers about a customer as they would leave. She has not charged some customers for drinks because she was too lazy to redo the register. She will do other tasks and totally ignore you for up to 5min at the register at times because she only has 2 or 3 people in line. 

Beyond that individual who is most likely most of the issue I have also seen the following...

-This location has had a handful of employees smoking weed behind the restaurant in full uniform. 

-I watched everyone in line wait 10 min because 1 employee threw a sauce on the other as a joke. They both scrubbed down the employee laughing as we all waited. The worst part was there were 9 employees visible and no one said anything or adjusted to serve the customers. 

-Most employees wear headphones while they work here. They will mess up your order then get rude when they have to go back and remake your food because they didn't hear you. 

-Online orders are labeled ""ready for pick up"" but they actually hadn't even been created. I listened to an employee say ""we don't have chicken right now? Ok then I guess they will just get steak"" when referring to an online order. So in other words they intentionally got the order wrong and it's obviously they are intentionally telling people their order is ready even though it isn't. 

-When you ask to speak with someone who runs the place you are handed a card that directs you to a line that won't actually get you in touch with anyone. 

It is quite possibly the worst run facility. After waiting 20 min for food and watching the lady at the register yell at 2 customers today I have decided I will not be returning for good. 

If this happens to reach the owner. I would quickly make some changes before you have many more like me who will just flat refuse to come here. It's not the food. Its not the facility. It's 100% the people you have hired.",-0.965
"I refuse to return to this Taco Bell, I have continued to buy from there hoping it was an off day. Each time I get food from this place my order is either missing food items or they are incorrect. This last time the items were correct however the taco shells were hard and the meat had soaked thru as if these were not freshly done.   I strongly do not recommend this place.",-0.6025
"A friend and I came here after work. Ordered some drinks and the quesadillas. Maybe 2-3 hours later we both felt horrible -- as if it were food poisoning. We couldn't stop throwing up and using the restroom ALL night literally. This was my first time in life having food poisoning and I am livid! 

I haven't had a chance to go back there to speak to someone. There was a guy sitting adjacent to us that as well Had the quesadillas and I'm curious to know if he is alright. 

The bartender fixed the lemon drop STRONG & WRONG. It didn't even taste like a Lemon Drop Martini. Not to mention she charged us an extra $6 to make it a Martini when the drink IS a martini so there should've been no extra charge. They did NOT have Tanqueray in stock which made my G&T taste bad with the gin that she did use. 

I more than likely will not be returning outside of going to tell the manager about this recent experience. 

The bartender was nice, so that was a plus. We were really hopeful that we'd love this spot because our office is very close and it makes for a nice after-work gather spot. But I guess not anymore.",-0.4265
"I love the food here.  Literally, it's some of the best Venezuelan food I've had in Tampa.  In the past we ate here two or three times a month. 

However the service is atrocious. We call in a take out order and then purposely arrive LATER than advised because they're so slow, and yet we still wait 15-20 minutes AFTER we get there. 

This evening we called in a meal, and were told 25 minutes. My wife arrived at the 30 minute mark, and they asked her to wait. 15 minutes later they said ten more minutes.  That's almost an hour for takeout, and a half hour late, for those counting.

It truly seems that when ordering takeout, they don't start cooking it until you arrive.  Totally lackadaisical service with a rude attitude to boot.  

Shame, this was a go to spot for us, but tired of the lack of respect for customers. No more. 

You've been warned!",-0.7673

PLEASE DO BETTER!!!!! I love chipotle but this place makes me not want it again.",-0.5081
"This has got to be the fastest decline I've ever seen in a restaurant ever. I don't know if they lost a manager or what but this place has become an absolute dump. We walk in to nothing but a group of young kids working who lack any customer service skills or speaking ability.l, except to each other about sports disregarding the people waiting to be helped. The place is filthy and they closed off a section of the store to ""mop"" it, which is bizarre as literally every time we come in they have the same section blocked off, almost making me wonder if that area has a leak or something. The trashes are full, the tables are dirty the soda machine sprays at you splashing you, as if they don't soak the nozzles or clean the soda machine, and worst of all the food was awful. Luke warm, the queso came straight out of the plastic bag cold. None of the food was ready or cooked yet even though it was dinner time they had no food prepared they were out of most of everything. Chips were hard and chewy as if they sat for hours. I don't know why we didn't ask for a refund. Worst 30 bucks spent. This location has really declined over the 2 years I have gone here!",-0.9835

"This is my first time at the establishment. I ordered through the app. I went through the drive through and waited maybe 10 mins for my food. I ordered 2 cheesey roll ups, 2 cravings boxes with crunch wrap, beefy bean burrito, cheesy potatoes and Mountain Dew. I waited 10 mins for my food that I ordered 15 mins before picking up, they forgot the cheese potatoes, and my cheesey roll ups were not even melted, it was actually cold to the touch. I lost my appetite after my meal was ruined. I shouldn't be surprised since they are a fast food chain. This was my first time at this location since I was in the area. I would not go to this location again. (Unfortunately, I didn't take a picture of my food, I was very disappointed.)",-0.7241
"So we were looking for Mexican and we thought this place looks nice I found it on google. First off we arrived and the hostess was very unsure about everything. We sit down and the menu is pricey. To pricy for how the food actually tasted. Our server was rude and had an attitude. She forgot everything we had asked her for. It took her 15-20min to bring us our check after we asked her to. I ordered the 2 tacos with double rice no beans. They bring it out and it didn't taste good. I go to pick up my crunch tacos and it literally fell apart because they sat it up against my rice and it made the whole taco fall apart and get soggy. You can get better Mexican food by the mini donut truck downtown. Will never be returning.",-0.4937
"I bought a chicken burrito bowl that had semi raw chunks of chicken in it. When I brought it back to the cashier she asked if I wanted another meat. 
REALLY? Not an OH MY GOODNESS IM SO SORRY, Thank you for bringing this to our attention let me pull this chicken from the line so nobody gets sick. Nope.... She just saw me as a dissatisfied customer and wanted to keep it moving. 
I asked to speak to a member of management to make sure that this got pulled and nobody would get sick. 
Guess what? They both just stepped out. But she did let me know that I could come back later. 

Genius Cashier!",-0.4198

"Tried to make a reservation the day before, they told us that we would have to call when we were on the way because they don't take reservations for parties of less than 5. Tried to call and their phones were dead. Explained to the hostess and she said ""there's nothing I can do and you're not the only one."" Her snotty attitude was not appreciated.  Sat at the bar to get a drink and basically had to flag the bartender down to get a drink.  I used to love this place, it was started by the nephew of Mama Ninfa in Houston.  I can't go back after the experience this evening.  Even my waiter knew I was having a bad experience just from the look on my face.",-0.5577
"Can't even believe what the woman told me after me waiting 10 minutes for food during lunchtime they informed me that they only taking card that is the most stupidest thing I've ever heard and I will not be going back there ever again from any service.

She said ""un momento"" which translates to one moment. However, 10 more minutes past and no one has taken my order. They lost a regular customer for their lack of customer service this evening. I enjoyed the food on many occasions, but moments like tonight are what will make me stop patronizing a business.",-0.0772
"Officially banning myself from this location.  I live down the street and have been here a ton of times and the order is never right.

Not going here again . Save yourself the hassle and go to the better Taco Bell up the street on Westshore",-0.3327
"This place was fucking disgusting. Cold, old, disgusting food. I've already thrown the food away but pictures were sent to Uber Eats. The elote was old, burnt, and cold. The tacos were cold and didn't have any of the correct toppings. I would like to say that it could've been the delivery woman except for the fact this place is 5 mins away from my house, first and last time eating here. I know what you guys are thinking, if it's five mins away why didn't you get your ass up and pick it up yourself; I completely snapped my clavicle and can't drive and this has been the first ""meal"" I've eaten in the last two weeks. I- cannot.",-0.7346

"The food here was slop. It's obvious they spend their mony on the decor, not the talent or the ingredients.

I had a chimichanga (large filled flour tortilla, deep-fried, covered with cheese). It came covered it with about 3 ounces (a ton) of cheddar cheese, garnished with a couple of white onion strips and a side of yellow rice. As I ate it, I received a big mouth full of runny beans, cheese, and a soft tortilla (should be crispy). The meat didn't show up in the dish until I got half-way through, and when I got there, it was a pretty blandly-seasoned and soupy ground-beef slop. It's pretty clear that they had pots of beef and beans on their line and they spooned up a glob of beans and slopped it down on one side, then the same with the beef on the other side, folded it and cooked it - very careless and insulting.

I tried another dish from someone else in my party - alambres (skillet-fried chopped meat and veggies mixed with cheese, usually seasoned similar to fajitas). They also were very bland and had a rather mushy (not tender, mushy) texture.

Along with the dishes, we ordered a pitcher of margaritas. This was even more dissappointing; the flavor was very much poor (completely absent any fresh lime juice), and there was virtually no tequila, and it was $30 for that.",-0.0431
"We went there for lunch. I had the chicken quesadilla. For 1195 the problem was that the tortilla was either nine or 10 inch anywhere you go up 95 all the way down to New York The quesadilla is usually 12 inch and is about 8.95 I mean I don't mind paying the extra money but I hate getting ripped off and living hungry.and the most disturbing thing was it was below average",-0.9151
"Terribly disappointed with the tablespoon of meat I had in my 2 cheesey Gordita crunches and quesarito. I could've taken a tortilla and added cheese and lettuce for cheaper. Doesn't resemble anything as advertised.",-0.7717
"i am hard of hearing and never have i ever had any problems at any fast food restaurant having to pull up to a window and not speak into the intercom because i can't hear what they response. they proceeded to tell me to come inside after i waited in a long line and then tells me they don't do that until i explain that i have never experienced this. and then just cut me off short after i ordered, no sauce or anything and made me pull around the storefront. I have never felt so undermined with my own disability by a FAST FOOD restaurant. food is great, service is just embarrassingly rude.",-0.8818
"I am not a person who does not give a benefit of doubt.  This has happened for the third time in last month.  One out of four orders was wrong and two out of three orders had very little refried beans since that is the main filler.  They were really busy so they must had run out of supplies.",-0.7952
"Had not been to Miguel's in a long time, and after the experience I had today, it will be a long time until I return.  We were sitting at a table and noticed other tables, who had arrived after us, being waiting on.  When we stopped the hostess, we were told that they were looking for our waiter.  15 mins later the waiter was found.   Unfortunately, that was not the only misstep.  The food (tacos and taco salad) was disappointing.  The ground beef was unseasoned and bland, the cheese tasted like cheap bulk cheese and the taco shells fell apart when picked up.  The final slip up came when we are overcharged on our bill - in some instances charged double for an item.",-0.7003
"I take issue with this place for a number of reasons. First and foremost, I must say as a California native and a new resident of Tampa, I don't get why everyone seems to be up the ass of California Taco. I've had better tacos from tiny food carts outside of bars late at night. I've been to taco trucks in the ghetto of Los Angeles with better food and more polite staff. As for the decor, I've been to dives in Tijuana with more charm. The woman who took my order was RUDE. There's no excusing how rude this woman was. My fiancé ordered a burrito and asked for the guacamole on the side so I could have his extra. She refused to put it on the side, because HE wouldn't be the one eating it all. I mean, if I pay a price and something is included in that price, I have every right to get something on the side. I was too tired to argue with her so I just gritted my teeth through the entire unpleasant experience. When I got my burrito, the meat was dry and the tortilla tasted like something bought from a store. I pray that someday a decent Mexican place comes to New Tampa and shepherds all you poor souls into the light of edible California inspired fare.",-0.857
"I don't know why the good reviews. The customer service was good BUT the food is nasty. Threw away most of it because the shrimp tasted and smelled frost burned like a wet smelly towel. The Barbacoa was so dry and lacked flavor. The steak/asada and fried grouper tasted pre heated and the tacos had nothing special with any flavor. Just very disappointed. There are taco trucks that are better than this.",-0.523
"The absolute worse Taco Bell I have ever been to. The customer service is disgusting. Every time I go the cashier has an attitude and is angry I bother to make her to her job. End of story just rude staff. 

They never get the order correct either. Late at night they only accept cash and refuse to give you receipt so they can pocket your cash. I don't know how this place stays open.",-0.93
"Horrible TACO BELL. Customer Service is horrible. 2 times now we have gotten home with no taco sauce nor were we asked if we wanted any! Called when we got home and were told next time we come back we should ask for sauce. This is no BONEFISH.. Its Taco Bell and they said we could drive back up to get the sauce. That was their solution, which was no solution . This TacoBell is the worst

"Visited this Taco a Bell/Pizza Hut on a Sat early afternoon before the lunch rush. Ordered food at 11:07am, pepperoni pizza. Waited 20 minutes before going to ask about my food. Finally got my food and after eating a slice of this dry pizza, noticed sticker on the box said, ""ask for fresh product after 11:05am"". They had made me wait and gave me old product! Complained to shift mgr, who wasn't very overly apologetic. Called 800# and they said store mgr would call. Didn't get a call until 5 days later and he also wasn't overly empathetic. I'm not one to complain but, this is just horrible service all around and I'm spreading the word wherever I can.",-0.7443
"I came here back in early January during my vacay with my man and will not be coming back. I spotted this place driving by one day and thought we should try it out. This is NOT an authentic Mexican restaurant and sorry to say it but the food was not of great quality and was quite nasty. Despite of the staff being courteous, the vibe there was just plain weird. They were just standing around waiting for people to either come in or be done with their food to clear up the table quickly. Maybe we went on  a bad day but the odds of both of us feeling the same way about the food which was pretty gross, are pretty slim. That is all.",-0.5691
"I REALLY hate to give them their first 1 star but I am honest and I'm not going to sugar coat anything. We stopped in today craving tacos. We were seated right away and one of the very strange men working their served us. He was awkward. We were pleased to see they had everything we were expecting on the menu. I ordered horchata, esquite, and the special 3 tacos and soup. The man went off to prepare the esquite first which took a while before he even brought us our drinks. When I got my esquite it was COLD and the top had so much cheese that it was just gross. Then came the food 3 tacos and soup.. the meat in the tacos literally looked like shredded pulled pork and had no flavor. The tacos were orange and thick looking .. not your traditional tortillas. The soup had NOTHING IN IT. I hated my food to say the least. Then finally we got the horchata and it was nothing special at all... it was so watery. The service here was terrible, the men stared at us weird.. and they had no personalities. The food is not good here and I do not recommend it what so ever but worst of all on top of hating my food.. when we got the check he charged us an extra $1 for cheese on my tacos which he did not tell me it was extra nor did I realize it was for my tacos. I thought that it was for my elote because he asked me if I wanted cheese while asking me about my elote. These people are ODD. Stay away",-0.9557

"We will never come back to this restaurant again. We have had margaritas at several restaurants and these were the worst.

"This is a tough one. I've had two experiences here. One was decent. The other was horrendous, thus the 1 star review. Cinco de Mayo... around 6pm, everyone wants some tacos to go with their margs right? Right.

Well we went here to order some takeout. Line was long as expected, we knew what we were getting ourselves into so we placed our order and took off to get some drinks. We were told the wait would be about 45 minutes to an hour. Reasonable given that it was cinco. We give it an extra 15 and come back around an hour, it's not ready.

So I'm waiting patiently in my car for maybe another 30 minutes, go in and check again. Total wait time about an hour and half. Still not ready. When I ask how long, i was told ""I honestly, I don't know. Our kitchen self imploded."" That's fine, I understand that, I worked in restaurants for 5-6 years. Totally understand those nights happen so we head back to the bar for more drinks with friends...

Another hour and half'ish goes by before I finally get the call for food. At this point we've waited over 3 hours for tacos and a burrito. It's almost 9pm and in finally getting my food. I was told I was going to receive a voucher in my email to cover the meal considering I had to wait almost 3.5 hours to get a few tacos but I never received any sort of communication.

Maybe chalk it up to a chaotic busy day, but I dunno, it's not like there were many dine ins with COVID, and 3 hours for some tacos and a burrito?",-0.8456
"Don't go to this location! The staff is very unfriendly and the service is slow!

I had an online order for 5:45, my husband gets there at 5:50 the order had not even started yet. My husband leaves around 6:05pm... not only were they late they weren't friendly to him as well.

Enchiladas, Chimichangas, Mexican Rice and Refried Beans. All of it was extremely bland. And the little flavor it did have was not good. 
Another negative is you have to pay for chips and salsa for an appetizer. Then the in the salsa, all you can tastes is the tomatoes. Not too much of a salsa taste at all.

"First of all, I have been here before in the past and enjoyed their food, but after this instance I will not be returning. My review will probably not change people's minds about this place, but I thought that everyone should be aware of their gross business model.

Yesterday we came early to beat the lunch rush- we were the only people there at 11:15. We order, and after a while another couple comes up to order. After 15 minutes, the couple who ordered after us grabs a bag of food, gets in their car and leaves. We get our food about 10 minutes later... we open the bag and it is not our order.
I immediately brought it back to the counter, and Pedro apologizes and says he will have our food out in 10 minutes.

Ten minutes later, the couple who ordered after us comes back, exchanges bags with Pedro at the front, then leaves again. Pedro promptly brings us the same bag the couple just handed to him after being in their custody for 20 minutes and says ""Here's your food!"" Here, there are multiple problems.

1. Pedro was not planning on disclosing that he was delivering us food that had just been on a 20+ minute adventure. What happened to our food during that time? We will never know... but through the bag we could see that the burrito had been unwrapped and was loosely re-wrapped in its foil. Besides the fact that you just don't re-sell food that has been in other people's hands, he didn't even check inside the boxes to see if they had taken bites out of it! (not that we wouldn't have eaten it anyways)

2. Delivering us tampered/cold food that had been on a mysterious road trip shouldn't have been an option- they should have been cooking our food again when they told us that our food would be out in 10 minutes (our guess is that the couple called and said they had the wrong food and would be bringing it back in 10 minutes).

3. After I confronted Pedro, asking ""Is this the food that the couple just brought back?"", he said ""Yea, is that not okay?"" We told him it was not okay. He said they would re-cook our order, however we had already waited approximately an hour for food at that point and were quite grossed out by this incident, so we requested a refund.

4. Our whole mystery burrito adventure would have never happened if Pedro had checked to make sure the right food was getting to the right person. It would have taken two seconds to confirm the contents of their order.

To think that if we were not there to watch the couple bring back our tampered food and have Cali Tacos re-serve it to us makes me question how often this occurs here, and also what other dirty business habits they have. While Pedro did give us a free meal for next time, we will not be coming back.",-0.6556

Saying that the lobby closes at 11 and to ""read the damn sign"" and go ahead to drive thru. I've never had a problem at any other Taco Bell where they act like total assholes. And if the lobby is closed at 11 then close the doors!!! Lock them!!! That's 2 hours past and that's out of code and could risk the security of the restaurant and establishment. I've never even had to go on this app before this but honestly they don't deserve the almost 4 stars they have because I was starving and just wanted to get food so I could go back and making more money so I could feed me and my gf.

So, we (my husband and I) decided we are here lets give them a shot. We ordered the 3 amigos app, taquitos app and the chile relleno. The 3 amigos was pico, watery white cheese dip, and from the bag guacamole. Why not add some pico and a few pieces of fresh avocado to make it look good. No, it was green slime on a place.

"Very disappointed with California Tacos, my first visit will be my last visit.  I order the fish tacos and the California burrito to go.  After getting home with my orider I ate the taco first and have to say it was okay.  It was very dry like they forgot to put the sauce on it.  So I moved on to the burrito...looking forward to fries in my burrito as I had never ate that before.  After a couple of bites, I never tasted any fries and didn't see any in my burrito. My order was wrong.  I called and talk to the lady and she yes I got the wrong burritos, but that they would give me frees ones if I came back up.  Well this place was about 15 miles away and it was raining hard.  She said no problem, come in the next couple of days and she took my name.   Today on my way home from work I thought I would stop for my burrito...I was greeted by a very rude dude who said that the girl was new and no I could not have my burritos, that all he would give me is fries but he really didn't want to that.    I am very disappointed, I paid for the California burritos and didn't get them nor would he give the difference in the money.  Really all I wanted to do was try the fries in burrito.

The soft taco was soaking wet. Like it has been dipped in water and then wrapped in it. The Doritos taco was smashed in 20 pieces. It was crazy.

We never did get a call back. All we wanted was an attempt to make things right or even for them to act like they cared.

I just wanted to inform them.  After a few days they got back and said they would look into my feedback.   The woman told me she checked with the restaurant and nothing was up on their end so it must have been something else or stomach bug.   For those that have unfortunately got food poisoning in the past, you know the difference.   All I was looking for was an an acknowledgement and apology.  What I got was you were wrong and thanks.

I was confused by there being a buffet area in a Mexican restaurant. Anyway me and my husband went to here for lunch on taco Tuesday, we both ordered tacos (chicken and beef)  we got back two plates with inedible nonsense on it. The tortillas were soggy and they looked raw, the beef tacos were so greasy I had to spit it out. The chicken was bland and had what appeared to be way over cooked peppers. The side of beans and rice my husband got tasted like baby food and on top of it they had the nerve to charge $4 for that 3rd grade art project. We paid the bill and tipped the server but that was a horrible Mexican food experience. I won't be surprised if that place is closed down in a few years. We're on our way now to loli's for some real Mexican food.

And the noise level oh my god the noise level was off the charts. Of course a table of Adults ignoring the behavior of their children behind us and no one is engaging the nest of unruly kids that they brought with them only to ignore them and let them throw things and scream and run around the table. I won't break my back to spend $70 for 2 people without drinks mind you to be crammed in like a sardine and have to tolerate parents who can't control their kids.

When I started to complain about it, the employee hung up on me and let it go to voice mail so I couldn't ask to bring it back and get my money back.  This was my second time here.

Meanwhile, her coworker threw a bag of queso on the food preparation counter (which had random bits of meat on it) and proceeded to look for something to cut it open. He cut it open and put the end of it in the chafing dish, let it pour out, and the bag actually sat in the queso for a bit while the first employee was scooping queso from that dish onto the lady customer's plate.

"You fail again. It never fails that you forget something on my order. This time was my own fault because we didn't check the bag for accuracy. Now I'm home and have to eat my chicken chalupa without my chips and salsa. Is it really that difficult to have your staff check the bag versus the order to ensure all items are in there!? Seems to be the norm, along with staff that just appear as though they don't care and are only there to collect the pay check. Last time I dined with you I looked in the bag quickly and didn't notice that my bag of chips only had 5 in the bag. OMG. Now the $1.59 tonight for the missing chips adds up to $3.18. Losses on my end just keep adding up. Why do I go back to this Taco Bell!? Thanks ruining my dinner tonight once again.",-0.9172

"What a nightmare!  We were drawn in for a light dinner by the cheerful lighting on the outside and the empty parking lot. In this area, an empty parking lot means one of two things - everyone is shopping or the food is awful. We learned that not only was the food awful but the service was worse!  No one greeted us at the door, so we headed for the bar. After 15 minutes, we found someone and asked for a menu, at this point we should have left, but no!  Another 10 minutes go by, a female bartender does us a favor and asks us if we are ready to order.We say ""yes"". She takes our menus, puts them in their spot behind the bar and walks away! We look for a manager, we have now spent over an hour in the horrible place and were beyond upset!  We explain our experience thus far and he tells us he knows all about it and we should ""have a nice night"". Well, we did!  We left and went across the street to Outback!

Very disgusted by this and didn't want to cause a scene, I called my server over to let him know. I mentioned that I would prefer pico instead of more salsa. He arrives with the pico and made a point to tell me that he just wanted us to know that they normally charge a couple of bucks for pico!!! What?? Do you normally serve hair in your salsa??? I was offended that he would even say that to me. It was not my fault there was hair in my salsa. By this time, I have lost my appetite to even dine there. The manager was very nice when I called her over to explain why we were leaving. She did everything in her power to keep us there, however my server ruined that for me. I didn't want a free meal, all I wanted was an apology for the hair in the salsa and pico to replace without the attitude of the server. I will never return there and will tell everyone to choose a different place to dine.",-0.5145

In the next several weeks I called three more times because the refund never went through. Every single time I was told that the refund was processed at that time. The last time, I spoke to Kayla who said she was a manager and that she would ensure that it went through. It never did however.  I Finally contacted corporate (almost a month later) and they told me the refund still hadn't gone through and that they would put it through. Beyond unsatisfactory customer service at this store. I've been to chipotle many times over the years and haven't really had a problem.  But now their customer service is horrible!

Do yourself a favor and go to Westshore they have it together.

Carlo says they have a 2 for 1 margaritas for $8 which my wife & i order. What he meant was they have a single margarita that you can share.

We flagged down two different waitresses to go find him.  We needed our checks.  He appeared and took care of checks for a large table of men.  Still he ignored us.  One of our group finally got up went into service prep area to look for him and found a person to complain to.  He came out from back putting on his gloves and silently settled our bills at table.

They then refused to take my cash payment (exact change) no sign saying they didn't take cash. Rice was awful. Icing on the cake?

"Sat outside. Music was too loud. Asked them to turn it down. They didn't. Hostess gave us a menu,  but no drink menu. Weird for a ""restaurant and tequila bar.""  Waiter took our drink and appetizer order after bringing us the drink menu, but no napkin/cutlery set or water. Asked us if we wanted chips and salsa and brought it,  never telling us it wasn't complementary. When the drinks came--20 minutes later with not an update from him as he served other tables -- they were both horrible. He set down our drinks and apologized for the long wait, explaining they had run out of simple syrup and had substituted some agave nectar so I should taste it. It tasted nothing like a mojito, but like it was made with plain carbonated water. We pointed out that simple syrup was just sugar melted in water and could be made easily. My husband then tried his Cadillac margarita, which was supposed to be made with grand Marnier. It tasted like tons of tequila with some sickly sweet mixer and was orange. He gave up and ordered a negro modelo. We got our second round of drinks 20 minutes later;  well, he got his beer (which turned out to be a modelo especiale) and I had to remind the waiter about the jalapeno margarita I ordered. By then we had tried our appetizer platter, with water he brought about 40 minutes after being seated. We had to send the waiter back for small plates,  silverware,  the blue cheese sauce that was supposed to come with the boneless buffalo wings, and a refill of the tiny salsa bowl which came with the chips. The blandness of the appetizer cemented our decision to leave without ordering dinner. Summary of appetizer: nachos tasted EXACTLY like taco bell nachos bel grande, the tomatoes were mealy and flavor-free, as was the drizzle of sour cream. The quesadilla was edible, the boneless wings were Tyson frozen buffalo nuggets and the flautas were full of mushy unrecognizable stuff. They comped our chips and salsa but we ended up paying  $28 for a sad appetizer,  a beer and a margarita. Needless to say,  we won't be returning.",-0.8693

"This is probably the most disappointed I've ever been in a restaurant, for the fact that I could have ended up needing severe medical care. When ordering tonight we asked if all the rice had corn and if it did to not put it on there because I had a severe corn allergy and the lady at the counter said that it was not made with any corn. Thankfully, the rice they put in the container instantly caught my attention and I opened up my burrito to look before taking a bite. There's clearly corn in it. Seriously? You would have been responsible if I had a severe allergic reaction. Don't tell me there isn't any corn in your food if there is. I wouldn't have gotten anything. I specifically asked. That's incredibly dangerous and irresponsible for a chain restaurant. Waste of money. Can't even eat my food and could have ended up hospitalized.",-0.9091

How are you a franchise that serves burritos, tacos, etc. and you say you don't have black beans or tortillas. In the past, I have done mobile ordering on the app and my food was wrong more than once, so that's why I stopped doing that, but the in store experience is just as bad.

So I said I wanted my money back! She told me there policy is no refund! She said she would give me a store credit! Why would I ever want to eat at a restaurant I don't trust now? If you eat here, just know that they will not refund the money and you take a chance on getting the same cook I did! He might or might not do something to the food, but I won't take that chance!

A very poor service the food is not fresh anymore.  The worst part is I normally check my food before leaving but because she took my order so good I didn't and when I got home I was so upset.

"This restaurant has a USDA Prime filet mignon listed on the menu under $30 and was promoting Kobe beef fajitas at $29.99. Really?? C'mon. This is a joke. How dumb do they think their guests are? If you know food, you know you are not getting these items at that low price. Don't believe me? Then ask to see the prime filet packaging before you order it... or their purveyors invoice. Ask to see the proof. Restaurant owners, just say Kobe style beef or American wagyu etc. But don't insult my intelligence by saying you are selling actual Kobe beef when YOU ARE NOT. Also, this is not authentic Mexican at all. It's barely Mexican at all. This is Tampa, though but still. We were party of 5 and got our food in under 15 minutes (all premade stuff not simply pre-prepped) Not worth the money they charge at all and it's not even expensive restaurant. My pork was dry and my chicken was dry. The tortillas do not appear to be made in house. The queso blanco was the worse quality. They don't even make their own sauces. Asked for a typical Mexican green sauce in a Mexican restaurant and seriously the server gave me a bottle of some store bought hot sauce. Like, wtf. I can't even. I felt like I was in a Gordon Ramsey show kitchen nightmares or something. No no no no no. I hope to never ever see this place ever again. Sorry, but absolutely no.",-0.9711

When I looked on line to order I should be paying $18.00 when I got there my bill was $23.00.
When I questioned it the manager claimed it's because the web company they use will not change the prices, so obliviously they know it's not correct but they keep it up anyway.
How misleading this company is they are like crooks with a bait and switch tactic.
I do not recommend this establishment at all with bad business practices that they use daily.

"Just purchased some steak tacos, 10 wings and fries from the Taco Holic's food truck. Huge mistake. The food was cold and had been sitting, some of the chicken wings were raw and literally had blood coming out of it. I live right across the street from where they were in the apartments located right behind CVS on Bloomingdale/301 S So my food did not get cold in less than 5 minutes. It was served cold. Shame on you for serving food to your customers like that. I wasted $30 on food that even warmed up didn't make it any better. The food appeared to have been sitting for hours and all she did was lightly warm it up and added some cilantro and sour cream. I will never support this business again. Spent $30 on food that was not edible for human consumption. Just Awful! I want my money back!",-0.5487

"Here we go again --- yet another 1 star from me....but if I could rate them ZERO stars, I would totally do that.  This place is CRAP --- the only reason I come here is my daughter loves Taco Bell and this location is convenient to our home, otherwise I'd not come to this place at all based on the CRAPPY service that we've gotten so many other times before.  But after yesterday's visit, I am 100% boycotting this place and will NEVER return to this location.  I hate writing angry reviews but this is warranted and I hope nobody else has an experience like mine.  I work in a customer service environment myself and would NEVER treat a customer the way we were treated.  I'd actually be embarrassed to work for a company or even a manager that treats people like scum.  So here we go with our experience:

I went through drive thru and placed an order for a shredded chicken quesarito, a side of creamy jalapeno sauce, a side of nacho cheese, cinnamon twists, and a frozen Baja Blast.  The clerk repeated my order to me and I confirmed that it was correct on the screen.  Drive around to the window and pay --- due to COVID I put my own credit card in the machine and they don't give me a receipt so I drive up to the next window to get the food.  It's all packaged, handed to me and is sealed w/a sticker.  I open the bag quickly to count my items and drive off....expecting my order to be correct right?  Well, get home and I have to get logged back in for working from home and my daughter un-bags her meal...comes to me and says ""Mommy, they didn't give me a quesarito again"".....instead they gave her some sort of cheese burrito/wrap thingy (don't even know what it was).  As disappointed as I was that she was disappointed, I couldn't run back up there like I've done before to have them exchange it for what I ordered as I had a call I had to jump on in 10 minutes.  So I decided to call the store and complain about this and told my daughter that unfortunately she would have to just eat what they gave her.  

I called, a girl answers w/no greeting just a ""hello"".  I tell her that I was calling to complain about an order that I just went through drive thru for and in the middle of me talking, she says ""hold on"" and hands the phone to the manager (I'm assuming), again w/no name or greeting just a ""hello"" but with a major attitude.  Now know that I did not have an attitude in speaking to the other girl but I did get one when this lady picks up the phone and has one w/me w/o even knowing the circumstances.  I say ""hi and that I wanted to complain about an order that I just picked up through drive thru"" when she interrupts me angrily and says ""YOUR ORDER WAS CORRECT"".  I counter with ""excuse me?, you didn't let me finish"".  To which she asks for what I ordered --- I tell her my order and she tells me that I didn't order that.  That I ordered a burrito and that's what it said on the screen that they asked me to confirm and she stated that I confirmed that was correct.  I told her no, I confirmed that I ordered a quesarito and it was correct on the screen.  She asked me ""well tell me how much you paid, how much was your total"" to which I tell her ""I don't recall since you all don't give me a receipt"".  She says ""WE DON'T HAVE TO GIVE YOU A RECEIPT DUE TO COVID""....say what!?  First I'm ever hearing that receipt exemption is part of the COVID protocols but whatever.  I shrug it off....and she doesn't let me speak and is telling me (in a heated voice) that she made the order and she knows it was correct and she's not going to do anything to fix it....now yes, this did get my temperature rising and I was so angry by the way she was treating me that I was literally shaking....yes, I did yell right back at her and tell her that the order was incorrect and I didn't have time to run back up there but ultimately I wanted to have a credit for the next visit as I paid for a quesarito and I don't even know what they gave me.  She told me that if I continued w/my tone that she was ending the call.  I yelled back at her telling her that I would change my tone if she changed hers...that she began this call w/an attitude and CLICK!!!!  WTF!!!

My hubs and daughter were sitting at the table w/me and both looking astonished by the call --- they know that it really takes some effort to get me this angry.  And I was beyond that point --- literally still shaking with anger.  My hubs grabbed the bag, dropped the food in there and headed up to Taco Bell since I couldn't as he was going to go confront her and get a copy of the receipt to show what I paid for versus what we received.  When he returned home, he told me about his visit and I am still in disbelief that we were treated the way we were by this lady.  She is the manager of that location and an older lady but we could not get her name as she or the other staff members would not tell us. Read David L's reviews for this Taco Bell and you'll find his side of the story.  We called Corporate!",-0.9918
"Time has not been kind to Taco Bell....or at the very least, this location. I ordered 3 different items off their value menu (which are all now $1.39 and higher)....and SHOULD NOT BE CALLED ""VALUE"" MENU---there is ""NO VALUE!""

Last time I was here, all these items were $0.99.....and tasted fairly decent.

Now, in addition to being extremely overpriced, all 3 items (which were all different items) tasted vaguely the same! Too much spice...too much gooey 'processed"" cheezey whiz...same old tasteless, lifeless tortilla!
For the $4.52 I was charged....I could've went to Polo Tropical, Checkers,  or even Burger King.

My advise?

AVOID taking that run to the Border---unless you go to Chipotle or anywhere else! Time has run out (and over) the Taco Bell of yesteryear! 

I give them a big ONE  BARF!",-0.8131

"I'm usually very patient and tolerant because I'm also in the food service industry but and I mean but!  I arrived around 9:30 p.m. Thursday 1/28/2021 and I've never been so shocked by such a rude person.  She's an older woman working the counter and normally I wouldn't allow the disrespect she gave but I decided to let it ride.  She was impatient and rude with her responses as if I was bothering her.  My son and I decided to try out taco bus for the first time and it may be the last.  I hope the owner/management/corporate reach out to me so I can give a play by play on her horrible customer service.  The only upside was the food was good, my son and I enjoyed it as we ate in the restaurant.  In these times of uncertainty and pandemic a job is vital and not a given.  Someone needs to explain this to her especially at her age. very disappointed!!",-0.8285
"I would not suggest placing an online order unless you plan to intentionally get a veggie bowl. I call myself trying to do a kind gesture by ordering online with the pandemic to reduce interaction with workers. Well I ordered a bowl with double of everything and literally just ate a bowl of fajitas. Like how is 5 cubes of chicken considered to be a chicken bowl? Double sour cream was just a slight drizzle . Why are the orders like this when you order online but everything is fine in person? This is the second time this has happened! I suggest you all get it together with online orders since this is probably going to be the new norm for quite some time.

When I arrived, there weren't many people there but I noticed everyone was waiting for food. Not s large place so that's understandable. My turn to order, I first ask if chicharrones were I stock. She didn't m me what that was so she got the cook and I explained it him, pointed to it on the menu, still baffled until I said fried pork skin. Then I ordered the Horchata drink and she kept pointing to the bottles of Jupina soda asking ""what flavor?"" I explained, it's a drink over ice, so she charges me for one. 30 min go by and she calls my name to pick up my food. I asked for red hot sauce and lime wedges, which used to come w your order by default, she said they no longer have that and that it's changed. Chicharrones with no sauce or lime. Smh. The fish in my taco was way over cooked, dark brown and dry. Very disappointed being that I used to frequent and love this place.",-0.8558
"Worst Taco Bell ever! Asked for no sour cream on my tacos & they put it on there. Missed a burrito off my order & put no sauce on my cheesy gordita crunches.

My husband asked for hot and mild sauce when the kid just picked up a handful and dropped it into my husband hand and all over the road outside drive tbru.

"I just left Miguel's after choosing to eat our Christmas Eve dinner there.  I can tell you that choosing Miguel's was a terrible mistake.  While the food was very good, our service was disheartening and very disturbing considering we chose to eat there.

Our server was very flippant and refused to return a dish we had mistakenly ordered.  When I pressed the issue and asked for the Queso Fundido instead of the melted cheese, she said ""you are eating the cheese, I cannot replace it"".  We were forced to order the queso fundido separately.  In addition, we had 3 separate instances of waiting long periods (10-15 min).  Lo and behold, my daughter noticed our server on her phone in the bathroom on more than one occasion while we were waiting.  I realized there was an automatic tip for our party of 7, so she must not have have cared about taking her time.

No problem. 10 more mins go by after marking staff food (wearing chipotle T-shirt) I finally get my order. I ask for a side of cilantro. The cashier asks the line (Beatriz) and she rolls her eyes.  At the register waiting I can see this. That is horrible to see as a customer. I was told there wasn't any prepped and no one there was authorized to cut any. I call the store when I leave and the man who answers the phone informs me that he can cut cilantro (I assume a manager or shift leader?) and that he was never informed of the necessity. Lack of communication and customer service yet again.  Upon getting home I find that my food contains 1/2 of the toppings selected. If you are out of things inform the consumer! Or cancel the order.

"Had a terrible experience here and mainly because of service. My boyfriend and I ended stayed at the restaurant for 2.5 hours from the time we entered to the time we left, and we only ate for literally 15 mins.  This review may not be helpful for many but the reason why service was so bad is probably the fact that we were not spanish.

Upon entering the restaurant at 1140, our first clue should've been the fact that a group of spanish men that came after us was greeted, and order was taken before we were even acknowledged.  We then ended up having to wait for another 40 mins and  reminded our server that our ordered drinks were still not brought out. 

Through the course of waiting, tables that came and ordered after us were served before our plates were even served. Total count of 3 tables after us!! The restaurant was very small so we saw everything. The last straw was when a family (that arrived at least 45 mins after we ordered) plates were served before ours and they ordered exactly the same entrees that we did!  We brought up the issue that we have been there for two hours and the two servers just asked us to wait without even an apology or explanation as to why it took so long. 

I don't mind waiting for food as I am from New York and some places there is anywhere from a 1-2 hour wait but this was a different situation where others were served before we did that came so much later. What I don't understand is the fact that we ordered the exact same thing. What kind of business is this??

If your are not Hispanic don't bother going there, because even if you arrive when it opens at 1130 you will still be the last one to eat at 130pm. I understand that this place is busy but this is just plain ridiculous, I guess non-Hispanic customers are not preferred here.",-0.9344

We take the sandwich back and speak with manager. He said ""ok, you want another sandwich!?"" Of course we said no. He gave us a refund and said ""here you go.""

Steak was full of nasty gristle, and the queso side I got was pretty boring too.  Plus it came with another plate of chips - so here I had 2 plates of chips, an awful burrito, and a drink.  

$14.  For $14, I could've gone to the ten other places within walking distance and gotten something palatable.  Terrible.

"What garbage ! I order off Uber eats and get a message from the driver after 20 minutes that it would be an hour wait. They told her that they have no way of canceling on their end which is a lie! I try calling several times while the phone goes to voicemail, such bullshit!",-0.783

"Overpriced and incredibly lacking in customer service. I was driving in from West Palm Beach to Tampa over the Fourth of July weekend so I thought I would call in a to go order for dinner tonight.  When I gave them my phone number, they said my name and asked if I wanted the same as before, so their system knows this isn't my first rodeo!  I placed my normal order, asked if I could get less cheese (bc they always over do it) and if I could get their hot salsa in addition to their regular salsa. I was told that my order doesn't come with chips and salsa. I asked her ""since when?"" and explained that in the past when I've placed an order for pick up I always received it, but she said again that they do not give chips and salsa with to-go orders. I said, ""so let me get this straight... I order a $20 plate from you and you can't give me $3 salsa to go with my meal?!  Let's forget about the chips, but you won't give me $3 salsa to go with my meal that I purchased from YOUR restaurant when spending $20 bucks?!  Who the hell eats Tex-Mex and doesn't use salsa on what they ordered!""  She said ""no"" and asked if I wanted to talk to a manager. Have I seriously just stepped into the twilight zone?!  
So the bartender taking my order doesn't have the ""authority"" to throw in chips and salsa or even salsa for a customer that is spending $20+ on a to-go order?!  I told her after she asked me the second time, that she has my phone number and if she wanted to have a manager call me she could, but I will never step foot in that restaurant again and I will never recommend it again as I have so many times before.  In fact, we usually go there 2 to three times a month and I will now never go again. Sometimes it's just the principle and this was one of those times.  To think that they are willing to lose a loyal customer over a $3 salsa was and still is unbelievable to me!  So instead I went to Zappata's which I highly recommend because there you get chips AND salsa with your order, and it's great Tex-Mex, HUGE portions and MUCH cheaper, imagine that!

No call from Manager at Miguel's, wouldn't matter anyway unless it makes them change their stupid a$$ ""no chips/salsa with your order"" policy!  I also complained on their website. Hope it helps, bc that is ridiculous!  Smdh",-0.9327

"For this place to be called a Mexican restaurant is beyond me. We walked in about 730 on a Saturday night and it was really empty. We sat and had chips and salsa brought to the table which were not the best. We had ordered a few drinks sangria and a margarita with our food. She had ordered the shrimp and steak fajita combo. Very plain and no seasoning at all. I had fish tacos which were so bland it had some seasoning on it but couldn't taste anything. Also had beans and the Mexican rice. The rice was hard and crunchy and the beans were out of a can. This is my review after hearing the table complain about the food they had. Please I have learned from experience now and will do my research from now on.",-0.6556

I told her never mind, that I would pull up to the window but they wouldn't even acknowledge me through the window.

"So yet another complete disaster. Wife goes through drive thru to order some food. She gets home and the order is incorrect.  There is no receipt in the bag so she calls the Taco Bell and gets pushback that they don't give receipts because of Covid and that the manager made the order correctly.  Manager ask for the total paid to ""look for the receipt"".  Obviously you're not going to remember that off the bat. 

So I decide to drive down there to resolve the issue. By then we had identified the amount since it was paid via card.  I get down here and ask to speak to a manager.  They immediately knew I was connected to my wife from the earlier call as I could hear them make some comments in the back.  The manager immediately says,""I made the order right.""  I tell her to stop because all I'm asking for is the receipt. Since that's the ONLY way to tell if the order was correct or not.  I give her the amount, she does a cursory look and days oh its not in the system since its been too long.  That's BS since they report all transactions to corporate.  She says she isn't going to replace anything or do anything else and walks away from.me.  I ask her for the corporate number and she just says it nonchalantly as she walks away. 

I call corporate and while I'm on hold other customers come in.  Realize one employee IS NOT wearing a mask so obe customer just walked out because of it.  When I get corporate on the line and. I call out to the employees for interaction and they ignored me...all while corporate could hear the interaction.  Finally the two at drive thru have a side whisper and one walks over to me so I ask for the managers name. He tells me out loud while corporate is on the line that he could not give it to me.

At this point, I'll have to wait for the GM to explain why I was treated poorly and how so many corporate rules were broken and whatbthey are going to do to fix the issue. I would NOT recommend this Taco Bell to anyone and would give ZERO stars if I could.",-0.9024

I almost thought I was at McDonald's the service is terrible. Everyone must have skipped customer service training. This store is the closest one near my house and every time I go in they tell me they're only accepting online orders. The manager can never give me a straight answer on why this is. I even told him I'd pay more to make my food. They said sorry and turned me away this has happened 5 times in 1 month. To tell you the truth they all should get fired so they're eligible for unemployment bc no one is working anyways.

it'll only get 0-1 star because of their customer service skill is zero to worse + staff didn't wear gloves + mask with nose poke out + no social distances apply in rule.
I walk in at 8pm decide to buy 1 entree take out ended walk out the door at 8:50pm. 
Host direct me to the bar area, their is 2 bartenders and 1 server with 4 tables of customer, I stood there by the bar about 10 minutes until first server notice I exist, handed me a menu then never return to myself but going to her service table the whole time avoiding taking my order, another bartender going to the high boy and bar back and forward passing me also ignoring my existence for another 10 minutes, I finally spoke up ""Do I have make a reservation to speak to specific person to place a to go order?"" Then the bartender replied "" oh you haven't order yet? I'm sorry, what would you like to order? I though you just waiting for pickup"" Really? I stood here in front of your bar holding a paper menu that didn't tell you enough I need to place an order? 
I place the order, didn't speak to anyone or respond anything to her, wait about another 15 minutes to get my 1 entree meal. 
Ohh, I didn't mention, during the entire time from standing at the bar until I get my food out the bar I saw that 4 original tables turnover once. ""Turnover mean - customer sat down on table, order, ate, paid, left another new customer sit on the same table again"" you can imagine how long I really stood there for 1 entree meal take out. 
Frankly, I will never recommend anyone go inside to place take out order, you'll be humiliated, and I'll never dine in there myself, I'll probably order delivery of their food (in an hour advance) since the food is really not bad at all, just the service sucks.",-0.9092

The order ended up being wrong when he picked it up (which in and of itself is not a huge criticism, as mistakes happen). However, the staff person was very rude to me about the mix up. I received a phone call from a staff member, I think her name was Stacy, and she told me that I gave her the wrong order, ordering what the kitchen prepared. I was surprised by this remark, and I informed her that somehow there was a miscommunication and what was prepared was not what I ordered. She told me that my order would take at least a another 15 minutes, which i said was okay with me, and the she abruptly hung up the phone on me. Overall, very poor customer service.",-0.7537

I asked the staff multiple times what is going on and they ignored me on multiple occasions and when they did respond they said it's coming next. There was another lady who ordered after I did equally as frustrated. I was finally able to complain enough to get a refund. In addition the entire staff in back making the food had masks all down to their chin. This is has to be a health violation with covid rising. They were all talking to each with masks not covering their noses or mouths. This was a horrible experience. I would never recommend anyone go to this location.

The sangria was pretty expensive for the size and wasn't that great. Ybor has many other better places to offer, I recommend you skip this place.

I also asked for hot salsa but didn't get one with my order.  The fries were not done enough to where it was edible wasted about money on that. Today I had another mexican food craving so I wanted go give it another chance. I went there this time and ordered 3 tacos and nachos no meat. I said how could you go wrong with these two. Easiest ones to make right? This place was able to screw this one too. I doubt that they understand the key cali/mexican inspired food is flavor. The pico de gallo had no taste. It was basically just cut up tomatoes cilantro and onion, dollop of sour cream and redried beans. Well just in case the first incident happens again i asked for hot salsa. When i got to open it, it was buffalo sauce. Why in the world would you give me buffalo sauce when i asked for hot salsa. I ended up using all of the buffalo sauce as the food didnt have any taste to it. I tried that but it didnt end well. Ended up throwing it away. The 3 rolled tacos were not rolled so the chicken filling must have escaped when they deep fried it. So basically i ordered a bunch of fried corn tortilla. The topping was ok, guacamole with cheese, i ended eating this one. I was already super hungry.  I wouldnt be going here. Kudos to some of you who gave them good ratings.",-0.0214

Arriving home less than a mile away, the order was wrong on almost all accounts (items missing), and cold to boot. The tortillas on the chimichanga were barely cooked (aren't they supposed to be crispy?), the pork and chicken tasted old, and the queso was inedible. 

When called about these issues the staff was argumentative, finally begrudgingly agreeing to replace the meal if I drove back. Having wasted over an hour at this point, and honestly not expecting much better, this was not really an option. Good riddance

Then when I ordered a burrito they came back and said the didn't make red rice today and if it was ok if they used white. I said ""ok."" Well, when food was brought to us my rice was undercooked.

Oh yeah the food... the Pollo Mole...chicken was as dry as sawdust.  Yuck.  Mole tasted like out of a supermarket jar.  Pulled pork street tacos... couldn't even eat them because the corn tortillas literally disintegrated.   Seriously, if you like Mexican food avoid this place.",-0.8126
"Worst Mexican meal ever! Either it was too bland or too salty. The chorizo is not even chorizo- it's mild Italian sausage and the margaritas are completely watered down. How do you mess up rice and beans? Well they did. They had no flavor at all.",-0.7901
"Short fat bald guy whose apparently a manager of sorts here caught an attitude with our table of 12 because one of us was using an e cig when the entire place is open to the outside. Instead of being subtle he came with nasty attitude and starting pointing at us to one of the other managers gesturing that if we did it again to kick us out. Which we had no intention to, we just didn't know. This place is overrated anyway, go to cheesecake better service! (UPDATE: I later found out that short fat guy is the owner, Mr. Rocco himself) even more reason he should've been more courteous towards his paying customers. Shame on you Rocco!",-0.4572

"Cold food, weak drinks, slow service, and strobing disco lights left a bad taste in my mouth.  I usually give every restaurant two tries before I decide if I like it or not.  This place won't even get a second visit.  Serious need to revamp.  The disco lights at 7pm were enough to give me a seizure.  Turn them off! It's a restaurant...not a nightclub!!!",-0.7482
"Utter disaster! Coke is 2.50 and they try to push the bottle coke on your first. I had 3 different dishes and they ALL sucked. The meat on the taco's was just cooked in a crock pot and had no flavor. All of my taco's came with a LEMON!  The pic on cldeals is a stock shot. Their tacos look nothing like that. Did I mention I got lemons with my tacos? Fish was drenched in vinegar some some insanely acidic stuff. The others were just watery and flavorless. I feel ripped off and I had a 50 percent off ticket. I say get the cldeal and go drink your ass off. Leave the food alone.",-0.9493
"Worst Vallartas ever. To start, I got the wrong beer, the food was horrible, everything from the tacos, the flautas, the carne asada, pretty much everything we order was bad. We were a large party and the service was horrible, from the moment we order the server kept asking what did you order every time he brought something to the table. We will not come back to this vallartas and do not recommend",-0.9314
"Absolutely rude! I don't know how these people stay in business with that kind of customer service.  3 of us went in on s Friday evening and sat down at the sushi bar.  They had two people working, and neither one of them greeted or even looked at us. After being there for 5 to 10 minutes, we left. While next door at one of the other restaurants in the plaza, another family was behind us in line, and said they were there for 10 to 15 minutes before leaving and the staff never even looked at them either.  Buy a clue!",-0.417
"All i can say is beware of being short change. We went in and completed order that equated $30.00 and was short changed by 5 bucks.

"This is hands down my favorite chain restaurant, however, this location is the worst I've visited. The Orlando and Del Ray Rocco's restaurants are great! This one, not so much. I realize they just opened, but that does not excuse the staffs rude behavior. It's pretty upsetting when you are turned away on your birthday because they refuse to put your party of 10 on the wait list. It's even worse when you are made to feel small by management. Never again, Tampa location. Never again. Rocco, if you're reading this, I hope you consider visiting this one and staying a while until you can get your staff under control and teach them a thing or two about hospitality.",-0.321
"They always skim on the meat. There was only about 4 small cubes of meat and the entire thing is all veggies and random fillers. They should rename it to salad bar. The only reason this place have business is because there isn't any fast food joints on the block and people are pretty much forced to eat there. Not only their food burn when come out they also screw you before eating it.",-0.4767
"Worse experience ever, waited 30 min until finally decided to grab my own beer at the bar, I let 3 servers know I was sitting outside and no one cared to bring us Menus at the same time had to grab my own menus, I was pissed when a group of 4 sat down and they ordered and got their drinks before us . I was a server place wasn't even that busy and I would not recommend this place . Plus side there was love music which was nice but never coming back",-0.104
"If you want a bland, overcooked or a dish you had not ordered that you need to try this restaurant. I'm okay with tex-mex but this place doesn't deserve a place among said establishments.

Please do yourself and everyone a favor and avoid this place at all costs.",-0.9454

We waited for 25 minutes for our food and when asked for a refund-the cashier refused and gave me an attitude. She kept saying ""ready any moment"".

We will pass this along to our friends as well.",-0.6743
"The worst food in Ybor City...I've been traveling for a long time and the food here was by far the worst ever. I ordered the beef taquitos and they were super greasy and the beef was way too salty. My husband had the enchiladas with rice and beans. The rice was ice cold and didn't even bother with the beans after that. The enchiladas seem to have been from a previous day and out of a can. He also had an Azteca soup that looked absolutely gross. I use Yelp a lot, as it's helped me a great deal and I had to comment on this restaurant as I was shocked at how terrible the food was. I was very disappointed with this restaurant.",-0.8847
"I Just left this place disgusted!!! One of the Guys working here was scratching inside his underwear and digging his nose!!! When I confronted him about it he told me to mind my business!! Just Nasty!! The owner needs to install a camera in the kitchen so he or she can see the kind of filth that's going on in this business. I definitely won't be back!",-0.8057

"Don't waste your time going to this location. Worst everything every time. Yesterday finally had enough and walked out before they could take my order.

"I am hesitant to even give this restaurant 1 star. But that star is for my waitress, who was a doll. I feel bad she has to work here. The music is 18 year old club loud. You can't hear your waitress, the people at your table, or yourself thinking. It is hot. Inside. The air conditioner may have been broken? But it has just opened and there was no hurricane, so that probably isn't it. I will go home and need a shower. I special ordered a margarita, and that was the only thing worth my money. The margaritas on the menu all have orange liqueur and their mix includes orange juice, which is not how you make a margarita. You just special order just lime juice and agave.
The food: disgusting? Worse. My fish taco had grey cold fish and then when I sent that back, I got a quesadilla (chicken) that didn't have cheese. In the meantime, after the grey fish went back, I ordered a glass of wine that had caked on food when it came. I will never be back. And I wish I went to brio, right next door.",-0.8661
"Oh, Roccos... The Sangria tasted like sprite, the margaritas were subpar and overpriced. The pineapple marg had something gritty in it, and when we asked the server said ""I'm sure it's fine."" The food was sloppy and lackluster.. If I'm going to wait over an hour for my food, it should at least come out accurate and hot, but it didn't. The service was horrendous. I came in for a shot of straight tequila and somehow the awful service ruined that as well. I'll give them the opportunity to make up for it in the future, as they are still new and working through the kinks.. but for now, we will be spending our money at Besito's or Miguel's or Loli's.",-0.6428
"Ordered the California burrito combo and two churros for delivery by DoorDash. DoorDash part was excellent. Sadly, not the same for the restaurant. The California burrito is supposed to have french fries -- none were in the order. The combo included a taco -- I order a portobello mushroom one -- it didn't come with the order. I ordered the burrito as hot/spicy with their special chili de arbol -- is was so bland as to be disgusting. Overall, this restaurant sucks and I would NOT order from them.",-0.3182
"Let's start with the fact that I am a fan of Tijuana Flats.  Their food is tasty and reasonably priced.  Have been to many locations in Florida.  My problem is with this location.  Unfortunately, I love really close to this location, it is by far my easiest spot to get tasty Tex-Mex.  However, the service here is reliably terrible.  There is zero point in pre-ordering, either by phone or online.  An elderly couple seated at the restaurant had to leave due to the diabetic gentleman not even receiving his drink order.  This was not a one time incident, it is a consistent problem.  If you have to go there, don't go hungry, and bring a book...",-0.2023
"I had always been a huge supporter of Estella's for about 10 years. That all ended when my wife and I went for an early dinner on Monday evening. 

Having been a regular for years we sort of had a routine of chips and queso, salsas (including the hotter on for me) followed by our meals which we would take most of home. 

This week was no different. The wife ordered her 2 tacos and I the #1 combo with beef. After filling up on the chips and salsa I wound up only having the taco there and brought the 2 burritos and rice home. As we left my wife wanted to go to the little ice cream shop down the street. 

No sooner had we gotten inside the ice cream shop and a bout of food poisoning stated up. It's now been over 40 hrs since the leaving the restaurant and the fever, stomach pain and other even more undesirable symptoms still exist. This is the worst bout of food poisoning I can ever remember having. I know for a fact that the poising came from the meal I/we ate at Estella's on Monday 3/26. My guess is the contaminated item on this visit was the spicy salsa since its the only thing I had which the wife did not.

Since reading some other reviews where others having repeatedly gotten food poising at multiple of their locations ...... I'll NEVER go again. I have had problems with about a dozen visits to Estella's over the last 10 years where I'd have immediate stomach issues thereafter but never really chalked it up the food quality or food poisoning for one reason or another. Looking back on it now, the last visit prior to this one also left myself and a coworker with food poisoning after having lunch at the location on S Dale Mabry. 

Now begins the search for the best Mexican place in the bay (any suggestions welcome).

"Inhad really high hopes for this place but after my boyfriend and I tried 4 of the tacos there we were very disappointed. I don't know if it was the cook in the back or what but it was the most bland burnt tacos I've ever had in my life :(",-0.8126
"Absolutely terrible service and cooks. Been here about 3 times now and every time there's an issue, for some reason every time I go in they are out of salad dressing even though when I ask , they offered to make some more since it wasn't that busy at all but that should be something done before hand, but my last visit topped it off. Got 3 bowls for the family and the chicken was so badly burnt that it made the whole bowl taste like sh** . Called in and spoke with a ""manager"" called TJ and he didn't seem to care. Prob won't be going to that location until they get their act together.",-0.5537
"The service was prompt and we were served chips and salsa as soon as we sat down.

I ordered a combo plate with a cheese enchilada, taco, beans and rice.  The food was not good.  The enchilada sauce tasted like tomato soup, there was absolutely no chili spice flavor or any other spice flavor.  The cheese was an very salty tasting white cheese.  The taco was ok but the ground beef was unseasoned.  My husband ordered a beef enchilada and found a bay leaf in his ground beef.   The beans and rice were standard.  I will not be going back to this restaurant.",-0.0257
"First the Rolled tacos...BURNT...hardly any guacamole. ..and some generic cheese...not fresca...and tasteless 
See my photo below.
Tacos were halfway rolled from FLOUR tortillas..not corn.
Those are not tacos..more like flautas..but hardly those...total FAIL.
 The burrito...nothing but fillers: beans, rice, CABBAGE?!...and 'Cali veggies'. Meat was DRY.
'Cali veggies'?..Please it's pico de gallo...which is tomatoes,  onion,  and cilantro. At least bother to learn the real name instead of that 'Cali veggies'.
There's a nothing remotely Mexican or California about this food. 
About the only thing authentic was the salsa verde.",-0.7772
"Second time coming to the location in Trinity. Margarita was horrible,food was horrible. 30 minutes without the water my lady asked for.  It was nothing like the location near the expressway. Food was horrible. Margaritas were way too sweet and the service wasn't good at all,they weren't even busy.  Never ever again will I go there. Maybe to another location,but not the one closest to me.  Total disappointment.",-0.896
"First and last time for this place. Food was less quality than Taco Bell. The menu depicts sides that you don't get with the meal. When you question the waitress she ""gives you the look like your a bother"" The place had 2 waitresses one with blonde hair and the other with brown hair. Both would frequently disappear into the ""woman's bathroom"" with cell phones in hand to the point that newly seated customers at the 2 tables new to us picked up and walked out due to the lack of service. If your craving Mexican food do yourself a favor and go somewhere else...Save the $$$ and aggravation... PLACE IS HORRIBLE!!!",-0.5121
"Not very impressed. Ordered 2 burritos and a large quac and the food was nothing out of this world. The guac tasted pre packaged and not homemade. The burritos were very big but lacked flavor. I do have to say that delivery was fast.",-0.2229
"Lying in bed sick I decided to order at 4:55pm. Had the order repeated twice. Waited 4 hours for a delivery that finally arrived at 9:03pm. I called they told me they attempted delivery and I didn't answer. I was sitting on the couch next to the door waiting. I continue to wait. After five phone calls and an offer to send a new order of food free of charge. I still continued to wait. He finally arrives carrying the bag sideways so all the sauces are settled at the bottom of this sopping bag of food. Just more out of morbid curiosity I opened its contents and the whole order is wrong. The food went in the garbage, shame! This place was great until management changed. Need to make some changes before you lose all your business. Oh did I mention they charge $3.99 for delivery.",-0.8172

"I literally just called to place a delivery order and I am highly disappointed. I ended up canceling the order after a lengthy irritating convo with what sounded like an incompetent teen with no concern for the business and no knowledge of how customer service works. I ended up asking him if I could speak to someone else to take my order. Once someone else got on the line I could hear said ignorant teenager in the background speaking negatively to another employee about our conversation. I immediately cancelled the order and will never be spending my money at this establishment again. Sucks because the food is actually good, but this crap has left a permanent bad taste in my mouth for this place.",-0.9403

The menu is a bit deceptive and it was my first time so I wanted to read the 1 page wonder. The server delivered my water right away and then disappeared for the next 20 minutes and I waited.
The gentleman at the counter, possibly the manager got involved in a lengthy discussion, with 3 teen age girls about what the 3 of them could order that wouldn't be too much and wouldn't be too little, but would be just right.
Did I mention the restaurant was empty except for me and the 3 young ladies that were together?  Did I mention the server did not point out anything about the menu? Did I mention, long after I had mad my selection, I had time to peruse a competitor's menu and make a selection from their menu? Did I mention, I have had this restaurant bookmarked and have really wanted to go there for quite some time? Did I mention Tampa has far too many good restaurants to sit in an empty one for 20 minutes and not have your order taken?
What's a girl to do? I guess it will remain bookmarked and I might get around to revisiting the establishment.",-0.7399
"Visited the location in the International Mall to celebrate wife's birthday on May26th. Food and service was just ok. Problem is the day after our visit I noticed that my bank had deducted more than the amount on my receipt. It seems the server had increased his tip. Spoke to 3 managers by phone with no corrections. Manager Tom was particularly condescending and rude. Will never again patronize this establishment.",-0.0422

"New and upcoming to Tampa. I have visited this location twice and on each visit the wait was horrific.  On both occasions I was seated at a small round top table that does not allow room for food and drinks. The food is awesome but the wait staff extremely slow which contributes to the delays.  After being seated it was approximately another 30-45 minutes to be waited on. Their downfall will be their service. I'm willing to give it another try once they work out the kinks.  Overall the food is quite tasty. Kudos to the cooks!! Management not so great and wait staff confused!  I have visited their location in Brooklyn and this location does not live up to its reputation.",-0.6955

"If you're looking for authentic Mexican food, Luna's is not the place to go. I've tried different things and didn't like any of it. The meat on the taco salad tasted worse than Taco Bell's. I also don't like that the place is carpeted...something about that makes me cringe. Every time we've gone, it's taken about 5-10 mins for us to be acknowledged...and we always sit at the bar. We probably won't go back again.",-0.7446
"Horrible food horrible service. Asked for no salt ok drink got salt. Asked for no cheese on tacos. Got cheese.  Chicken is burnt and dry. Taste like eating charcoal.  Asked for green verdese sauce for enchiladas got none.   Waited 45 minute and we ordered before the lunch crowed came in.",-0.7717
"This place is a joke.  Probably the worst server I've ever experienced in my life.  I've never not left a tip EVER in my life until tonight. 

We thought we'd try it out while in Tampa because it was so crowded.  I guess people go for the atmosphere.  It can't be for the food or service.  We weren't greeted for 10 min, we ordered queso and that took about 15 min to scoop some cheese into a tiny bowl.  It was cold and the chips were crumbles covered in burnt spices.  She never came back to take our order after we watched her standing around talking in the back.  I've waited tables for years, and I know when a server is busy with other tables, and when she just doesn't care.  The food runner was flagged down about our queso, and he admitted he never should have brought it out because it looked bad.  (Then why bring it out?) Not once did we ever see our server again after we placed our order.  NOT ONCE!  The food portions were a joke for the price.  I have a gluten allergy and they served me a FLOUR shell on an enchilada...which is listed as GF Corn tortilla.  We never saw a manager anywhere until I went to the hostess and asked if there was even one on duty.  We just wanted to pay and leave and couldn't get our server.  We were patient as long as we could be, but this was a ridiculous experience!  I will say the manager was very apologetic and comped our meal.  We didn't want that:   Just wanted them to know their staff wasn't performing their jobs , not paying attention to gluten free items, they weee all standing around chatting.  We offered to pay for our drinks and left hungry and annoyed.  Never will be back! If you want tacos, stick with Bar Louis tacos next door!",-0.8502

"Went to California Tacos today (9/2) around 3:00pm. Ordered two tacos and a burrito. With maybe 4-5 other people in the restaurant, it took them 45 minutes to make our order. Not only that, but it was wrong AND cold. They offered to remake the taco, which they then promptly forgot about while discussing their plans for the evening  and chatting up friends/customers who had come in for food. We then had to re-ask for the taco to be remade. They asked an additional 3 times what should go on the taco. Overall the food was sloppy and poorly prepared and the service was horrible. Honestly, it likely had more to do with the employees working there that day since this is usually one of my go-to taco spots.",-0.5499
"Zero stars! DO NOT place an online order you will not get your food. Then the establishment tries to blame Grubhub when it was California Tacos To Go's issue.

Our friend ordered the ""special"" which was supposed to be jerk chicken tacos but were a miss . She didn't even eat any of it . She said her ""tostone"" tasted like refried beans.

I wouldn't have ordered and made other plans if I had known. instead of being apologetic she was trying to control the conversation with an ultimatum type discussion, not impressed. manager where are you? you need to be there an hour before and until close.

"This location made me give up on Chipotle for almost a year - every experience here gets worse and worse. From constantly stale chips, to near raw chicken, the list goes on and on. Then, I had chipotle again at a new location and fell back in love with the place so forgetting my trauma came back to this location since it's close to my home. Again, stale chips, chewy pink chicken, dirty counters, unfriendly service.",-0.8578
"Friday was my first time. Went with a group from work. We got there at 11am but by 12 it was packed. Service was very slow. My food was awful. I originally got the special I think it was called el patron. It was supposed to be shredded carnitas. What I got was a pork chop on a taco shell. There was nothing pulled or shredded about it.  And there were huge chunks of fat. Also will menation this special was 16$ and included no sides just 3 tacos. That's it. So I sent that back and got the slow roasted pork. I think they called it chochonitas Which took 30 mins come out. Isn't the meat already cooked? Hmmm. It was equally as awful. I guess they cook it with cinnamon. Worst taste ever. The server didn't seem to care to much about the fact that I didn't like my food. More of a, that sucks . One of my coworkers had a hair in his food. I'll also mention that the ground beef queso was steak not ground beef. It had huge chucks of pepper and onion. I didn't like the chorizo queso either. The atmosphere in the place is happening though. Great decor. They have a tv screen in the bathroom stall. Which is weird considering it's behind the toilet and ladies don't stand up so...they were playing the original star wars. The bill was astronomical for 8 people and we bought no alcohol. I will never go again. Way over priced.",-0.9487

"If you want mexican food, go to Chipotle, I have eaten questionable street food in CDMX which tasted better than the food here. This is a great place to grab drinks, eat guac and chips, but stay away from the food, its bland, and a very poor attempt at serving ""Mexican"" food.",-0.3694
"This was the worst Mexican restaurant I have ever been to. It started when my husband ordered a margarita, the server just walked away...there are a ton of margaritas how do you know what he wants? I called for him to come back so he knew to make it on the rocks with salt please. Our server also brought everything out with gloves on...but defeated the purpose by having those same gloves on and touching EVERYTHING in the restaurant. I ordered the quesadilla mexicano and it came out the size of a taco and not even cut. My husband ordered a chicken quesadilla with no tomato. He didn't even get a quesadilla we didn't know what it was and it was steak and filled with tomatoes! Not at all what we ordered but the server walked away and never came back. He went and sat at the bar with his fellow co workers watching a soccer game. He wrote nothing down while taking the order just said ""okay okay okay"" to everything. Clearly he has no idea what he is doing. And everything was extremely over priced for what you get. I don't recommend anyone to go here, so disappointed. I NEVER write reviews on restaurants, I downloaded the yelp app just so I could do this because it really was THAT bad! Do yourself a favor and stay away.",-0.826

Stood at what we thought was the host/hostess stand and asked 3 servers if we were supposed to be there but was assured it was the accurate location. After standing for 3 minutes we were walked by as if we hadn't been standing there and watched a host approach the party behind us which had just walked through the door. Terrible service. Zero Organization. Not worth the hassle. Would not recommend to anyone, will never go again.",-0.5594
"Ah what can I say? Visited this place while waiting for an event next door. They have the taco Tuesdaze and I ended up ordering a taco. My mistake was I ordered the hard tacos.

My ordered was done and the server keep on saying a different name so I was not responding everytime she calls outa different name until she approached me and had asked if i ordered hard tacos and I said YES. Then she left laughing coz she was calling different name. 

At first bite, the tacos was stale so i ended up just eating whats inside.  I have to set aside the taco. I'm not a big fan of Tacos but I'm hungry that time and really wanting to eat something but It was a disappointment. Just proves me that I never really liked tacos.",-0.7928
"My girlfriend and I just got food from the drive thru and we asked for no lettuce on 3 burritos and they all were smothered in lettuce,I ordered Doritos locos supreme and got just meat and a little cheese on mine,we're very disappointed to say the least 13$ for a quick lunch that we couldn't even enjoy,I called the location to speak to manager the phone just kept ringing and going to a voicemail so no one can even answer a phone as well",-0.4576

"Went to Roccos for the first time last night and it was awful. We waited about 30 minutes for our tacos and then had to ask the bartenders where they were... they said our ticket got lost in the kitchen. They comped our food and got the tacos minutes later. However my order was wrong and they never bothered with checking on us after our ticket got lost. I had ordered the hand made corn tortillas and ended up getting the flour tortillas and my tacos were awful. I took one bite and the attempted to eat them with our tortilla chips. I pushed my plate forward and then girl collected my full plate of food without asking why I didnt eat it. Clearly they messed up and then decided to ignore us. They atmosphere and vibe was awesome but the food and service was terrible. I'll stick with Bar Louie next door from now on. Rocco's could take a lesson from then on good service and food.",-0.6806
"Terrible from start to finish. We called earlier in the day to see if reservations were necessary for later that evening. We were reassured by the hostess that reservations would not be necessary but she did tell us that there was an event taking place 5pm to 11pm, but still, no reservations would be necessary and it would be no problem. We arrived around 8pm and it was steady but nothing overwhelming for a Saturday evening in a busy part of Ybor. We stood at the hostess station for 10 minutes without being greeted or approached by any staff. There were no other customers around waiting to be seated. We were about to walk away when our host arrived and asked how many. He disappeared for another few minutes and then came back to bring us to our table. Sat us and left. Our waitress arrived and before greeting us stated ""Just so you guys know, we have an event going on here so we're really busy so sorry if the service isn't that great."" It was almost like she was telling us we probably shouldn't eat here. We were kind of taken a back but the menu looked good and we were hungry and thought, how bad can it really be? It really wasn't busy, lots of people at the bars but plenty of empty tables. Again, seemed pretty average for a Saturday evening in this part of town. She took our drink orders and came back about 15 minutes later. Now I've had some pretty bad margaritas in my day but these were the worst I've ever had without a doubt. Simply awful. I've never had a house margarita that tasted like pure cinnamon until this day. We put our food order in, hoping for the best. How do you make a bad taco? She brought chips and salsas after 25 minutes. We had ordered queso as an app and that arrived cold and solidified. Cold queso is not great. Our entrees arrived and it was almost inedible. My boyfriend and I ordered chorizo tacos and they were so, so salty. How something can be so bland and so overly salty at the same time is mind blowing. The couple who were with us ordered the ""specialty"" steak tacos ($5 more than the ""regular"" tacos) and a beef burrito, same thing. Bland, salty and barely any toppings. I asked to order a side of sour cream thinking that would help and waited 15 minutes for that. The waitress ""kindly"" stated there would be no charge for the sour cream since it took so long to get to me. Gee, thanks? I feel bad. The waitress wasn't rude, she just seemed extremely overwhelmed and frustrated. Like it was shocking to her that there were people in this restaurant on a Saturday night, and after having the food it might really have been shocking that anyone was here. Definitely would not recommend based on even just the food alone. Literally reminded us of Taco Bell. Chipotle has better tacos and margaritas.",-0.9072

I will say the all you can eat fajitas were a hit!",-0.3404
"Soooo. Absolutely terrible. To start with, we were first introduced to our waiter by over hearing her speak poorly about another couple,  with no regards to her surrounding or who's hearing her. We came on Tuesday, taco Tuesday, party of 2, sat outside with a waiter with pink hair, don't remember her name nor would I want too. Service was sub-par. Our food came out before our margaritas. We sat looking at empty salt rimmed glasses for a extend period of time. The waiter avoided us as much as she could. Our food was cold, Guac was good, and Guac guy was friendly! Manager Ray, couldn't be anymore helpful as her. Insisting on telling me she's one of his best while being totally ignorant to my experience. We ordered a pitcher of margaritas, pointing to the flyer on the table stating it was $16.99 and unlimited tacos. So we each ordered such, 2 unlimited tacos but unfortunately we were 15 mins short to the margarita deal. Without knowing I asked when the bill came, very rudely and with malice she slammed the sign on the table and says ""it says it here, you can speak to a manager"". Without regards to the bill, as I had no problem about paying for the food. I had a problem with the way she carried herself and how she approached me. And with speaking to the manger about this he could careless. He spoke about a all of 6 words. And left with 2 unsatisfied customers as if he was okay with it.  Just a heads up, you're job is customer service, learn the meaning before you accept the job!",-0.9633

"I'm only giving this place one star because the hard boiled egg on the salad was kind of okay. The service at this restaurant was the worst service I've ever received from any restaurant. I literally made a yelp account to write this bad review. The food took forever and was cold when we received it. I ordered a burger well done and I received a burnt burger. There was no salt on any of the tables. Our table had no silverware, we had to go get some ourselves. The waiter was rude and talked down to us and gave attitude when we asked about items on the menu. He also refused to come to our table and admitted that their enchiladas were frozen so he couldn't take out the onions that my friend did not want on it. Furthermore, there were weird televisions in the bathroom that faced away from the toilet which makes me skeptical of their purpose. I can't even justify the bad service because the food was also absolutely disgusting and expensive. Save your money and go to taco bell because this place is shit.",-0.9681

"If I could give this zero stars, I would. We ordered 5 tacos & they messed up every single one.  Of course it was to go, so we didn't notice until we got in the car.  On top of messing up everything we ordered, the tacos had no flavor!  We paid $21 for 5 horrible tacos.  What makes this even worse is that we were the only people in there & it took 20 mins to get our order.  I guess we should have taken that as a sign since it was 12:30pm on a Saturday.",-0.8655
"Back in 2011, I went to California Tacos to Go on Skipper road after seeing the episode on DDD. I've gone back several times. Last week my husband and I went to this location. We ordered the fish tacos as usual and they were so sad. There was barely any fish and it was super greasy. The chorizo taco was delicious. Besides the food, my most serious complaint is the bathroom. The bathroom was disgusting, smelly, and the cleaning log was filled out sometime last year. The worst part of it was there was not even a soap dispenser or any site of soap in the whole entire bathroom. Isn't it a requirement for employees to wash their hands before leaving the bathroom?!  At least I had my hand sanitizer. Anywho, in typical E. Coli fashion, I got the usual signs and symptoms three days later and have been sick since. My husband told the employee that there was not any soap in the bathroom and he responded: ""There's no soap in the bathroom?"" *puzzled look. So gross!",-0.9274
"First time I tried to eat here I was told they were closed, over an hour early based on the time posted on the door. I tried again tonight, but thought they were closed early again because most of the chairs were upside down on top of the tables, but they assured me they were open. The manager was arguing with someone on the phone who received the wrong order. I placed my order and waited while the man on the phone eventually showed up and continued arguing. About this time the manager got a home call from another disgruntled customer who she told is they ever called back, she would notify the police. As I sat and watched the show, another two customers came in and placed an order for food. They got their food, the first disgruntled customer got his food and I was still waiting. I get home to find that neither item in my bag was what I ordered. Not even worth the time or trouble to go return this cold, inedible food.",-0.9224
"We just went in with 2 friends looking to have a drink and a quick bite. The host was to busy talking to some random girl and ignored us on top of that his pants where sagging and his butt showing gross. Then all the empty tables were dirty. The waitress said food is a 40 min wait ok I get that if they are busy. There was only 9 tables with people in them. Then we ordered drinks it took 20 mins for water and tea and 1 margarita on the rocks. The rest of the staff walked and talked like they hated guest being there and dress almost like the homeless man out front. Never go back here very disappointed. A restaurant that size in the heart of Ybor can make a ton of money but apparently the owner just does not care. They should sell and let someone better move in.",-0.4383
"We have waited for this one to open. After loving their West Palm Beach location we were excited to hear Tampa was getting one. Sadly, it was a huge disappointment. Service is terrible, my margarita was watered down (and no we didn't send anything back because I had two hungry kids) and the second one I ordered was wrong (ordered pomegranate got a regular margarita)  the waitress spilled water and no one cleaned it up but the girl at the table next to us offered her napkin. The mushroom tacos had no flavor,  my chille rellenos were just odd. And even worse the guacamole which is their thing, was over mashed, gray and flavorless. I know they are only a few months old but since it's an established concept their should be some
Consistency. Really disappointed we won't be going back",-0.9586
"This place is unbelievably loud. Too loud. When I'm having dinner I don't want to yell across the table to my friends just to have a conversation.
My friend is the margarita queen And she said the margarita from Rocco's was the worst Margarita she's ever had. She got some of the margarita mix to add to the drink and tasted it by itself. She said the mix was what was making the margarita disgusting. The mix is house made. I wonder if anybody else has complained about the taste of their house made mix not being very good? I got the watermelon margarita. It tasted nothing like watermelon. Ingredients of the drink say watermelon purée but that's not entirely true. They use Finest Call,  which is basically just watermelon flavored sugar water. 
The prices are crazy. Tableside guacamole and chips is $13! Do people actually pay that?!?! Needless to say, neither of us will be going back.",-0.9241

The mimosas were the worst we ever had. When we questioned the waiter, who by the way was outstanding, if they were using Prosecco he stated that because it was an all you can drink offer that they couldn't use Prosecco because it was too expensive and they didn't want to run out.  
Needless to say we were extremely disappointed but even worse were the tacos. My wife ordered the traditional tacos and I ordered the chorizo tacos. The traditional tacos had no taste and were horrible while my chorizo tacos were so spicy I almost  couldn't believe they didn't come with a warning that they may be harmful to your health.  In order to satisfy our appetite we had to order the ground beef tacos so we wouldn't leave hungry and they were at least decent.

"I go to this place 2-3 times a week.  I live and work in the area.  I went in today at around 4 pm for ""all you can eat fajitas."" The same thing I get every time.  I was the only one in the whole bar.  There were 4 employees working. One came to take my order who has done so many times before.  I ordered water, chips, salsa, and queso. After five minutes, that server had left, a new one was there, whom has served me before.  I asked him nicely for chips and salsa.  He brought it over. No plates, no napkins, no silverware, he even left the cover on the salsa cup. I then asked for those commodities.  When the food came out, i began to eat. The queso, was luke warm after about a minute.  I asked the bartender over and said, that I dine here every week, and today's service had been very bad.  I explained to him about the chips and salsa, and not getting plates ext.  Then I showed him the queso and ran my fork through the now solid mass of cheese, and asked him if he would pay for this if he were me.  He stated, ""Well, it solidifies after its been sitting."" Does it, after 2 minutes, no, it should not!  So he brought me a new one, asked if it was okay, it was almost the same.  After i finished eating, i waited another 10 minutes for my second round of food, as it is an all you can eat.  At no time during my meal did anyone ask me if I wanted another round.  So by the time the second round came out, I had to leave! I got my check, no itemized copy was presented, so hopefully I was charged right.

I'll start with my order. Chimichanga with rice and beans. It may be that I am from New Jersey but this is not a chimichanga. A chimichanga is a deep fried burrito. I added a photo because this is a flat burrito. It was no way or shape a chimichanga. I also just checked google and nope all chimi's are made like a burrito, filled as much as possible or to at least have a circle shape. This was more like a quesadilla than a chimi. Highly disappointed.

My co-worker visiting from Long Island ordered the crispy baja fish tacos. In no way was this crispy or tacos. He was not given the pineapple salsa, cabbage, or corn tortilla. This was simply a few pieces of fish on a flour plate.

Then we were told we usually get chips and salsa, but they were out of salsa at a Mexican restaurant on a Saturday afternoon. So we got some pasty guacamole another 10 minutes later. Of course no chips came with it, so I got to stare at it for another 20 minutes. I figured since I waited almost 45 minutes I had to go to the bathroom. I discovered no toilet paper in any of the Stalls and when I went to ask for more, the guy spent 5 minutes looking for some and said he could not find any in the whole restaurant. Seriously! So I unwrapped our plasticware to get a napkin. OMG! So an hour later I finally get something else on the table and it's nothing to do with my order. In fact she left it on the table and then came back later to take it away. not too long after she served it to the table next to us. Sorry guys I tried to warn you.Then I'm told the food will be ready in a second. At this point I'm still staring at the guacamole and asked the waitress what does a second mean? She says 5 minutes. Then she comes back from the kitchen and says so they haven't even started cooking it yet. Anyway, we left starving with no food over an hour after sitting at a table in this restaurant.

Turns out my bag had been sitting on a counter the whole to time.  Second visit I decided to wait on the long drive thru line another 15 minutes with only 4 cars in front of me. The issue is, this place is way too small for 2 restaurants to be in it. These poor kids who work here are running around on top of each other, very inefficiently. They ran out of cooked chicken at one point, wtf? It's not the workers who are the problem, I'm not sure how they keep smiling amongst the chaos!",-0.9418
"Stopped in here for lunch since we were in a hurry and didn't really have time to sit and dine anywhere. 

Extremely slow drive through. We ordered food at 1:57pm and got to the window at 2:09pm. Didn't get our food until 2:20pm. Omg. Extremely rude staff at the window. No communication at all -- just took my card, gave it back and slammed the window.  Sat there until she brought the food back. Looked in the bag and didn't see the sour cream or guac that I asked be on the side. Told her to which she screamed across the restaurant and slammed the window again walking away. Had to wait another good 1-2 minutes for her to return and then had to ask for the hot sauce which she seemed to be bothered by me asking. Absurd that I as the customer experience sick horrible service. I also had to ask for the receipt! Omg. 

I had the shredded chicken nacho box which was actually good. So good my daughter didn't hesitate to scarf some down too lol.",-0.6976
"I would definitely not recommend going to this Taco Bell. Last night my family and I went to Taco Bell and when we pulled up to the speaker in the drive through I've asked them if we could do two separate orders and they said we couldn't because there is only one cook then I asked them if I could just add on the order because I didn't pay yet and she told me no. So I just paid for the one order and got home and it was the wrong order. I called Taco Bell and asked for the owners number but they refused to give me the number.",-0.5279

"One star only because the hostess was nice and apologetic. The restaurant was slow and we waited several minutes at the table for a waiter or waitress. Went to the hostess and let her know nobody had come to the table. She said she would find someone and apologized and brought us water. Another five or six minutes passed and nobody came to the table or checked on us. In total we waited about 15 min without service. We got up and left, the hostess apologized again, but the supervisor standing at the front seemed un-phased that we were leaving because of lack of service. She looked at us and said sorry guys and went back to what she was doing.",-0.0516
"Have been a few times, but this weekend visit was my last. Was seated quickly on a busy night but the food was terrible. The burrito San Jose has huge chunks of pork that were so dried out that I would have guessed it was made another day. The peppers and onions were under cooked that it seemed like the meal was thrown together. The chips were stale. The kids quesadilla was the last to arrive at the table.

"Yesterday's lunch was not a good experience, wish I'd read these reviews first. Our waiter was a sweet guy and that's all the positive I can find to say. Margarita certainly wasn't good, not worth buying but carpe diem. Then first taste of enchilada sauce was kind of Chef Boyardee, still I'm no expert, so we started lunch. Then the man in next booth collared an employee and loudly debated immigration politics. His opinions went on and on. There were no waiters around so eventually just moved ourselves to where it wasn't quite so overbearing and obnoxious. And even though he watched us move, the employee let this guy carry on at him awhile more. No one ever inquired why we moved or stopped eating. I finally asked for manager, and that was a waste of effort. He basically kept telling me ""the 4 things waiters weren't supposed to talk about"", not helpful from a customer point of view. And yes, we still paid full price for everything, same prices as the know-it-all guy. We'll never return to such an upsetting place and I hope others will beware.",-0.9503
"This is one of the worse chipotle's I've been to and I love very nearby-very disappointing

There is basically zero consistency here.",-0.4784
"I NEVER leave reviews simply because I don't care but this place is so awful I couldn't resist so please let this review reconsider you making the mistake of spending (wasting) time and money here. First time was disappointing so I figured I'd give this location a second chance since it's so close to my job.  How do you fuck up guacamole ???  Nothing but bland avacado and HUGE chunks of onions, quality of the food is a last priority to this place. Better off going to McDonald's dollar menu, food is horrible service is horrible. Literally a waste of space.",-0.9663
"This location is the worst chipotle ever. First off, the parking lot is always... consistently a nightmare. Almost always have to park on the side streets. They never ever have online orders ready on time. Always left waiting for at least 10-15 minutes after the pick up time. The employees are rude and always claim they are understaffed and always have attitudes with the customers. I have never complained to any employees but have witnessed the rudeness to other customers as an observer. This is the busiest location in Tampa and they never have enough employees and are always out of something. They will tell customers they are out of something instead of making it when they have all the ingredients to do so. Never a quick process at this location. Currently waiting in line going on 40 minutes for my online order. The only reason I come to this location is because it's close to my house and my work. At this point I'd rather drive 20 minutes out of my way and sit in stopped traffic on 275 than put up with this store again.",-0.7764

"I ordered a chicken burrito, a chicken taco and chips and salsa. The food was not good. Hands down the worse mexican food I ever had around here. I called and talked to the owner and explained that the burrito was loaded with black pepper and that was the only thing I could taste. I couldn't even taste the chicken or anything inside the burrito. Plus the burrito was soggy. Long story short the owner offered me a refund and told me that he was going to sent someone at my place to drop off the money. Nobody ever showed up.

"First time here. Horrible.  I guess that the person in charge of hiring thinks the ruder the better for his/her staff .....It was obvious to the 14 of us that our server didn't want too work yesterday.  She only went to one end of the table and never asked anyone else at the table what they wanted to drink or eat.  Now if i was a server I would think big table big tip lets make these people happy.  It was obvious she only saw us a too much work!!!!  She didn't even want to bring us ice for the warm water on the table or a taller glass, she snapped at us when we asked for it....really shot glass for water come on.  The manager was disgusting.  I realize that the day before was Cinco De Mayo, but at least try to look half way decent when coming in to work where you provide face to face customer service!  She had on a black dress with a Kimono over it ... it looked like she took it out of a balled up bunch of clothes possibly her dirty clothes basket..her hair was not even combed and she wrapped it up in a hair tie just to get it out of the way.  She looked DIRTY and made me not want to eat....cuz if the manger comes in looking like she rolled out of bed no shower and threw on some dirty clothes I can only imagine what the kitchen staff looked like.   
I didn't realize that rudeness was acceptable behavior when you want people to come in and spend money on overly priced tacos.   I tried to avoid this route of posting a review anywhere but clearly they all have the lets be rude to the paying customer attitude.    I called the resturant and the manger screamed at me on the phone before I could tell her why Iso i decided to call corporate.  Talked to Pete.  He put me on mute and I guess the conversation going on in his office more important than a customer.   He released the mute button and I decided to end the call....He doesn't care either!!!",-0.9168

"I was at this location around noon on 2/5/2020 with my mom in the back seat. The employee MARISSA was disgustingly rude at the drive thru! I ordered a baha blast with my meal. When I got up to the window to pay she handed me a different drink that I did not order and dumped it. When she gave me the right drink, Marissa then ASKED ME if I wanted any sauces, to which I replied ""yes, fire please."" When I received my food I was disappointed that she did NOT in fact put ANY sauce in the bag. Therefore, I waited for her to open the window again. When she did, Marissa then told me I did not ask her for any sauce.... which is a LIE... and pronstead of apologizing for HER mistake she then told ME I had a ""shitty personality."" How DARE an employee speak to any costumer that way?! When I went inside to ask for the manager, a middle aged woman who claimed to be the manager on duty said ""she's got me."" Without allowing me to finish my sentence, this manager started walking away. She never once apologized on behalf of her employee and did absolutely NOTHING to rectify the situation.

I get the food in my car and realize it has an overwhelming raunchy smell. I opened the box to find that these "" shrimp "" look like they came out of a can - no larger than a nickel in size.

"Came to this place during lunch time and the first sign I should've taken was that there was no line when I walked in. I came in with 6 other coworkers and we were all disappointed with our food. I ordered a chicken quesadilla and a carne asada taco, the quesadilla was bland and the chicken was bad! The taco was decent but not for a place that says they're California inspired and the tacos taste nothing like the real Mexican tacos! The tortillas were cold you would think that they would at least be warm. Oh and I can't forget that the quesadillas were almost burned!  $15 wasted! I would rather chipotle!",-0.6109

Management won't force customers to wear a mask putting other people at risk (and yes you are allowed to deny service for this) but will threaten to call the cops (lol) if you eat outside (which you're allowed to do) even if you are social distancing.

They are pretending to care about their employees and customers health but aren't doing anything more than not allowing you to sit outside of their establishment. They aren't forcing customers to stand 6 feet but act like they give a shit about anything other than making money (even though their employees aren't even getting a living wage or extra pay for exposing themself to the customers that come in without masks)

"Let me start by saying that I only gave them one star because I couldn't give them zero !!!! 

Where do I even begin? As a California/ Los Angeles native,  this is straight up disrespectful in ALL aspects, no other way around it. I came to this place strictly because the name CALIFORNIA & TACOS was behind it. But boy was I wrong. 

The Food- Unseasoned, rushed (with slow service because they're understaffed) and severely over priced. No taco should be over $3.00, especially for what they're serving (which isn't much). 
The standard taco is like $3.98 and then they nickel and dime you by charging you another $.98 for steak, which runs what should be a simple $2.00 taco at BEST to a severely over priced $5 plus tax SMH. 

I asked for onions and cilantro (which in most CALIFORNIA tacos is the staple garnish of a taco) and come to find out THERES NONE IN THE BUILDING except for the pico is gallo they put in it. 

None of the staff members are from California, and come to find out the person who runs the place isn't from California either, THEYRE FROM MASSACHUSETTS !!!!

DONT DO THIS !!! This is straight up false advertising... 
Don't call that place California Tacos to go.... call it TAMPA tacos to go... hell, call it Massachusetts tacos to go.... BUT DON'T PUT CALIFORNIA'S NAME BEHIND THAT TRASH, THAT'S WRONG ALL THE WAY !!!!

At 12:07 we still didn't have our food. We had already closed out our check so I had to demand a manager refund our order. Magically she walks out with our food 1 hour after ordering it. Then the other bar tender decides to exude her ignorance and mutter something under her breath. A great look for a Restaraunt that knows they dropped the ball based on the other bartenders repetitive apologies. It was apparent the bartender forgot to put our order in even with us being the ONLY FOUR people at her bar. Utterly blown away by lack of awareness of care for their own stupidity.

"I had a horrible experience with this restaurant during lunch. I reviewed the menu online and called for them them to explain some of the items in it. I was having trouble understanding the lady over the phone, so I decided to drive over to try to see if we can speak about it in person. I find the lunch menu to be very confusing since you seem to get the same amount of food for $11.95 as you do for the $9.95 two roll option yet you get more choice on the two roll option which includes the same types of rolls to pick from as in the $11.95 option (or so I think...). They both come with a soup. I asked the host to please explain to me what the differences were on the menu items that she kept on going around my question and telling me one was a roll and one was sushi. She could have shown me the difference between what she meant by roll and sushi. Instead she kept on giving me the same answer, which was not clear at all and mid conversation, the sushi chef told her something in, I assume Japanese, and as she went over and started picking up after some tables and left me standing there without any service. It was very rude and demeaning. My question could have been in easily resolved within a minute and I even pulled out my phone to see if I could communicate with her via Google translate or pull up photos of sushi to see if I could understand what she meant. For some reason, she thought I was arguing about the price, when  if anything I just wanted to know the difference between the options since the less expensive one seemed like a much better deal and that confused me.

I ordered a bowl and the lady scooped me hardly any rice and then continue to only put the tiniest amount of meat possible on top.

I then politely asked if I could have some extra cheese on top and she rolled her eyes at me and literally sprinkled three pieces of cheese on top.

"Let's get this out of the way first:  my rating has nothing to do with the quality of the food or the service, both of which were excellent.  Normally, I would be looking forward to my next visit.  But this is dining in the age of COVID, and in light of my experience, I cannot recommend this establishment, nor will I be patronizing it again.

Our visit started off well:  a sign on the front door indicated that masks were required, and both the hostess and the server who took our order were properly wearing their masks.  I requested a table as far away as possible from other diners, and we were given an isolated table in the center of the restaurant.  So far, so good, right?  And then things started to fall apart.  A rush of diners occurred about ten minutes after we sat down, and the tables around us started to fill up quickly with large parties, most of whom were not wearing masks when they stepped through the front door.  These tables were never closer than six feet to us, so although I was getting a bit uneasy, I chose to stay. When our server showed up with the food, his mask was down below his lips, but he left before I could ask him to put it on correctly.  I also noticed that a number of servers and bussers were not wearing their masks correctly, or at all.  Now I was really starting to feel uncomfortable, but since we were still separated from everyone, we decided to finish our food.

And then came the mariachis.

When we first came in, we saw them off to the side of the dining room, in a recessed area about 10-15 feet away from the tables, and figured they'd perform from that spot. Wrong. As we started to eat, they strolled out into the dining room, all seven of them, and stopped about a foot away from each table along the perimeter of the room to perform a number.  The music was great, certainly.  All of them were singing lustily, and two alternated on trumpet.  And none of them wore masks.  Not one.  Before they could get close to us, we bolted down our meals and headed for the door.

A business needs to take precautions against the spread of COVID, and this one failed at every turn.  It was bad enough that too many customers without masks were allowed to come in, they were seating customers in a way that potentially limited social distancing, and not all of the staff were masking correctly.   But allowing seven unmasked performers, all of whom were no doubt spreading droplets of fluid while they sang, to mingle in close proximity with unmasked diners is grossly negligent, to say the least.  The fact that the management either doesn't realize the risk the situation posed, or perhaps didn't care, is astonishing.",-0.9358
"Went to chipotle tonight for dinner for the family. We were planning to go in to order but when we got there they would not let you order inside, the only option was to place the order online. We have used online ordering from chipotle a couple time before and each time there was something wrong with our orders (white rice instead of brown, not enough food, or missing an item ordered). I hope this is not going to be their new way of ordering, if so they have just lost loyal customers. People were turning around and decided not to eat there.",-0.2263

"Went to this location a week ago. Totally disappointed by the food
First I wanted to order a Dos Equis Mexican Beer I was informed that they must have sold the last two bottles.  I settled for a different beer.
When my Beef Burrito was served the chips seemed stale.
The beef in my burrito did not seem right.
I only ate half of it and left.  Later that evening I felt sick to my stomach. It lasted thru the next evening.  I'm done going to this place after many years.",-0.7713

What makes matters worse I get home with the order and it is missing the rice and beans, chips, and churros. I'm annoyed beyond reason. Terrible online ordering experience.",-0.9312

When we arrived,  the outside area was disgusting and only two chairs for about 4 tables. With that we chose to go in, order and we would take it to go. Upon entering the restaraunt it was quite obvious the inside was not much cleaner than the outside. (There was no line and only one table occupied). The kicker for me was when I witnessed one of the food preparers brush rice from the dirty food station back into the rice serving dish.

"I'm giving this a one star cause I can't give it zero. I ordered a mixed drink and it was disgusting. The drink was a simple Paloma (grapefruit soda with tequila). The nachos we ordered as the appetizer were not the best. The decor was nice but wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.",-0.5344
"Very sad....

I was so happy a few years ago to see Tijuana Flats and Jersey Mikes open so close to where I live (North Dale Mabry).  I am still glad there is a Jersey Mikes, but Tijuana Flats at this location is nothing like the one in Fishers IN.

I ordered dinner for 5 on 10/30/19.  Arrived at the time it was scheduled to be picked up.  Apparently the order was missed and it was thrown together while we waited (~10 mins or so).  The problem was how much the order was messed up.  Completely got one meal wrong and didn't give us a side we paid for.  When I got home and called, I was initially challenged saying it was made correctly...I said read the order (I had the receipt in front of me) and told them I would send a pic.  I was then told I could come back to get it corrected.  I said it was too late....I was home and did not want to come back.  Just refund me the one meal and side.  

I was then told I would be refunded the appropriate amount, but she would need to call the manager to see how to do it.  Fast forward to 11/10....no credit.  I called back and was told a manager would need to call me back within a few minutes.  Guess what....no call back.

I had to go through a lot of trouble to dispute it on my credit card.  It's only $15.46, but its the principle of it.  I won't be back.",-0.9277
"Worst meal and service I have ever had, period. I went with a friend on a Wednesday night and it wasn't busy at all. After a few minutes, a waiter arrived to take our drink order. We both ordered a water, which he promptly delivered with watery salsa and cold chips. Then he went to a table and started talking to other co-workers and rolling silverware. About 20 minutes later, he finally came back to take our order. By that time, our water was running low.

We each ordered tacos and they came with an order of refried beans.  The beans looked like they had been pureed. It was just a bowl of a white substance that was the consistency of a thick soup. It was very strange and tasted terrible. We both took a bite and left the rest. The tacos were disgusting. The tortillas had a very strange smell and unfortunately they tasted like they smelled. It was like a very dry rotten cardboard. We did not even finish one. During the meal, the waiter stopped by once and took my friends water for a refill and left mine on the table, even though it was empty. I thought perhaps he was coming back but he dropped her water off and sped away so I had no water for the entire meal because he did not return to the table again until he brought the check. I saw him standing by the kitchen all night talking to other co-workers.

I would never ever return here. The food is gross, the service sucks, and there are too many other places around with good food and friendly service.",-0.81
"COVID is not an excuse for poor, selective service. I ordered my food just as everyone else did and noted that my order was for dine-in, and still managed to somehow wait an entire HOURRRRR before I had to get up go to the register and inquire again about where my food was. The first time I kindly asked the runner if he had called my name. I was seated outside and noticed he was making runs outside, he was offering to run to the sauce bar, he was courteous to everybody, he smiled at everybody, he carried really good conversation with everybody. But suddenly I go inside and inquire about my food and he has it in a to-go box, with water dripping off the bottom of the bag, food flipping over in the bag and says, ""I called out about 10mins ago"". My food was lukewarm, no sauce offered, no nothing. I thought this was a genuinely nice dude but either he was overworked or just suddenly became a fucking snob when it came to me. It took everything in me not to go inside and get a manager to let them know how I felt about that. Instead, I'm leaving a 1 startl and letting it be known I'd rather shit in my hands and clap 100 times than to ever come back to the Tijuana location. COVID is not en excuse to overwork your employees and it damn sure is not an excuse to be nasty.",-0.9321
"Looked at the reviews and thought I would try this place since it's so close. I'm not sure if maybe they were having a bad night or something because my food was nothing like the reviews. I ordered Al pastor and pollo tacos and salsa verde. Everything was Very salty. The corn tortillas were hard and over cooked and the rice and beans are sub par in taste. My husband had a chicken quesadilla and he described it as too salty as well. I love authentic Mexican food and was hoping this place would be my go to but I am never eating here again. Waste of money.",-0.4829
"Purchased multiple pitchers, food, and shots at the bar area at a height too tonight. Music blaring so loud I can't hear  so I have to yell to talk to my friends. Having a great time, u til the manager lets us know we are too loud and need to leave if we don't stay quiet meanwhile the music is so loud I can't hear myself think. Will never spend money nor talk about this place ever again. Our bill each was over 80 dollars, and there were 8 of us. So it's not like we weren't spending money. Come here all the time, must have new management. But until this manger is gone will continue to dog this place and tel everyone about how shitty it is.",-0.4743
"Nothing really to talk about here other than the restaurant decor, the food is not only not authentic or Mexican of any sort it's also terrible, flavorless and covered in cheap cheese, spent $45 on two (gross) margaritas and the queso (also gross) so it was also an expensive mistake, I thought with all the check ins and pictures here I see on my feed maybe there was something I'm missing out on, but sadly no, just come take pictures and go to whisky cake or cheesecake if you want something tasty to eat or drink you'll thank me",-0.7311
"Was looking forward to sitting at the bar and having a late lunch.  Unfortunately after I had put my things down and took my mask off to sit down a man walked up to me and asked if I was going to be watching the game.  I told him no and he then proceeded to try to relocate me so him and his buddy could take my seats.  This would have been fine in a non COVID 19 world but the only seat left at the bar was next to a stranger.  Then as this is all going on the bartender gets involved in the conversation and tells me I can go to the inside bar where no was was working and he would get to me as soon as possible.

"Extremely rude and racist staff. We were told the bar is first come first serve so we grabbed two seats and sat down. Nearly 5 minutes had passed before the bartender would even look up at me. She refused to welcome us or say hello, I politely chose to say ""hi"" to her first to which she sneered ""hi"" back almost under her breath because I barely heard her. 
 She pushed one menu between both of us that she picked up from a dirty table, then proceeded to help the other customers on BOTH sides of us with a cheery and entirely different demeanor. The difference was like night and day. It was obvious and disgusting. When she finally came back around she said to me ""Do you know what you want?"" impatiently and then did the same to my husband. When I requested a drink she barely let me finish the name before cutting me off rudely with ""we don't have that."" She then went to get another girl to serve us while she conversed and laughed with the other customers. What is going on here?? Anyway, the drinks were terrible.

She also didnt want to fix the order and when we ask if we could purhase some peppers she stated that we need to do that when we first order.

"Today. Never in my life had I had such worse service at Roccos Tacos bar in Tampa. 

The two bartenders had no smiles on their faces and moved at slow paces, checking their phones and drinking (watched the girl take a shot) behind the bar in front of us. 

We ordered 4 tacos for the $3 taco deal. 
Once the tacos come out it was put it down with no questions and no eye contact or even asked asked if we need anything. 

I get it happy hour can be annoying, it's cheap- less tips, okay. 

Both of us have empty waters and I saw there was no sour cream we wanted. 
No biggie, I asked the guy for a side of salsa and sour cream for my 2 tacos. 
5 min go by and he is wiping the same spot on the bar and watching TV.

Maybe he forgot? Maybe he had to ring it in? (We find out later, yes he did they do cost money) Then, I had to ask the girl to get the salsa and sour cream because my boyfriend was just about done his tacos at this point, 10 min later it comes out with 4 sour creams and 2 salsas the size of the 2 tacos themselves. 
I show complete excitement and gratitude for them, no response or check in again or eye contact even. 

Waters are still empty. I ask for another marg and refills on our empty waters. She makes my marg, then no refills on the water. So now I'm staring at her hoping she just forgot to refill them, but she then poured warm water into my old marg glass that she never took out of the way with no ice in it and didn't even fill it all the way  

We get the receipt, they charged us for 4 $1 sour creams that I used half of one, and $1 in salsa, for the salsas where only I used one. 

It is not the $5 of condiments that took 10 minutes to come out where we only used a portion that caught us off guard, but the just disinterest of us as customers truly bothered us. 

We went out for taco Tuesday to have a good time because of a stressful situation we are in currently, and we actually ended up leaving in a worse mood and more depressed because of their attitudes. 
Both of us have been in service industry for years doing all of it. All the way from host to takeout to server to bartender to manager, and maybe our expectations of simple courtesy is too high. 

My boyfriend and I had to come up with scenarios as to why the service was so bad. I don't know-I don't care. BUT. It still isn't good to be in the situation we were in. Call out or fake it till you make it, bartending is a job to make people happier not to make the guests eat off the bartender's depressively contagious attitudes.

So much so that's one of the people in their party actually went to sit in the car, it grossed them out so bad. We should have gotten up and walked away after learning that information however we were very hungry and figured our table was alright... SAT FOR 15 MIN AND NO ONE CAME TO EVEN ASK FOR OUR DRINK ORDER. After waiting this amount of time, watching waiters walk in and out of the building, asking tables if they needed anything more, we got up and left.

Quesadilla had very small amounts of meat on it and the shredded cheese wasn't even melted completely. Just to top it all off the house $11 margaritas had no flavor and were watered down as if they sat on the bar for a while. Everything was extremely pricey and the quality wasn't even comparable to Taco Bell. The server was well aware of our dissatisfaction and offered nothing in return.

I'm Awful place, typical South Tampa pretentious, unwarranted entailed staff. On 12/23/2020 in the midsts of a global pandemic I asked the hostess why they were not requiring patrons to wear a mask when moving about the restaurant and in the bathroom; she told me it was a personal preference and if I was concerned ""then to wear a mask""  (which I had on). I asked to see the manager and he said ""they don't require it and they don't post signs so, it's not required.  This establishment is exactly part of the problem of the spread this pandemic.

Then I received notification that the order could not be delivered. I called this place immediately but no one answered the phone and the voice mail recording did not even identify the business. They even confirmed my phone number so they could have called me to let me know they were having difficulty. I suspect that the driver gets to keep the food if it's undeliverable. That may explain the reason for non-delivery. DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS RESTAURANT AS THEY ARE UNRELIABLE. Also, will be deleting the Uber Eats app as they are also unreliable.",-0.6019

"So, I decided to give Tijuana Flats another chance. Why? I'm asking that very question of myself right now. The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results. Tonight's experience, if anything, reminded my why I quit going to this location a few months ago. Silly me for thinking that things would be better than my last visit.

We ordered our food, then find our way to I've of the few clean takes I've the restaurant. It took an exorbitant amount of time for the food to arrive, then it came incorrect. My girlfriend ordered sour cream for her salad, but they put it on my daughters burrito instead. Problem is, my daughter is lactose intolerant. Unfortunately, she did not figure it out until several bites in, then complained about her stomach ""not feeling right"" for the rest of the evening.

I had also ordered a large side of queso, but it was not brought to our table with our food, so I had to ask for it. Our server, ""Dee"" was combative with me, and scowled that I must not have ordered it. Still determined to be the cheese police, she reluctantly brought a small side of queso to the table. I then asked her to bring me an itemized copy of my receipt as proof that I paid for a large. Ten minutes later she came back with my receipt and another small cup of queso. No apology, just a snarled explanation that two small cups equals the large which I had bought and paid for. I beg to differ, but I'm not going to argue over something as ridiculous as a soufflé cup of processed cheese.

I got the wrong enchiladas and my friends got the wrong chimichangas. If you ask for no cheese, you're apparently going to receive cheese regardless. Our waitress was friendly but not attentive at all. We could've easily racked up a 200$ bill on drinks alone but she was MIA the whole time. We had to remind her three times for a margarita and we still never received it, never received our remake on the f*cked up food either. To top it off, 3 out of the 8 of us got sick as hell from the enchiladas. I would not recommend. When it came time for the check all of ours were wrong. No manager came to resolve the issues.

Now, if that's the case you would think management would have put visible signage up before the customer walks into your establishment. But no, there are NO signs anywhere. Only reason I knew because there was nobody in the front counter taking orders, no food stations where food was supposed to be and I have to ask the lady next to me and she's like I'm ordering online because that's how they want it done! Horrible job by management. 

Now if you want to go to online orders only I have no problem with that but make sure to get this message across with proper signage proper online ads etc. etc. before someone actually walks into your store and wants to order food like it has been done for years and years. I won't come to this establishment anymore. Lost me as a consumer.",-0.9336
"This was by far the worst Mexican food of my life! I ordered chicken fajitas and I was very disappointed. I normally give places second chances if I don't like it. This Mexican food was so horrible I will never try it again. I don't mean to be mean or disrespectful but I'm disappointed in the quality of food! I would go to Taco Bell (yuck) before this place again.",-0.9156
"Food was great but server was so rude! My daughter did not like her chicken teriyaki and we sent it back. She had barely touched it. The waitress said we cannot return an item once the dish comes to our table which is ludicrous. I told her to replace it with something else. She took the teriyaki away and brought us the chicken nuggets instead. Then she charged us for both plates of food! Sorry but we will not go back. $12 for some chicken nuggets? That is ridiculous. Osaka and Shogun sushi are all excellent alternatives.",-0.8778
"I have been frequenting chicken and taco loco for years now, especially while they had only a food truck. The new restaurant opened literally 1 minute from my house, while I have only been there to dine in, today I decided to order to go. To my disgust, I ordered my usual 3 carnitas tacos. However, when I returned home and opened my box, all 3 of my tacos were FILLED with chunks of pork fat. Is this how you treat your to go orders? Cause I'm DISGUSTED and now my tacos had zero meat in them. I PAID FOR MEAT AMD GOT ALL FAT. Highly disappointed. Do better!",-0.7817
"I had a horrible experience here with the manager Chloe. She confiscated my real ID and refused to give it back. I understand this is her job, but she was extremely rude to me. She brought her scanner and ID book to my table which caused a huge scene. She spoke to me like a manager should never speak to a customer. After this my whole meal was ruined and was no longer enjoyable. I had to drive all the way home, get my passport, then drive all the way back to retrieve my ID. It's safe to say I won't be returning to this restaurant if that is the kind of management they hire.",-0.0873
"Service is horrible from the start and you can tell soon as walk in... Tables with no guest are dirty and no one cleaning them off... Line forming at front and not a single employee even making eye contact to the door. They take the couple ahead of us and than poof disappearing act like we weren't there waiting.  You wait at the door for 10 minutes or so and finally have to signal to the back hey what the fuck need to be seated.... 

Once you get seated you think ok maybe they got the jist... Nope .... You sit and get quick help  and get chips and your drink and guess what you do after ?? You wait and wait and wait and wait longer.  And right when you are about to get up to leave they come and finally take your order ... 

As I write this more came in and just waited and as I write this more just left.

As far as the food. Bland and sucks. Had chicken tacos and no season no flavor.. pretty much got chicken out heated it up put on flour tortillas ..

GO ANYWHERE ELSE BUT HERE !!",-0.8623
"Waited 30 minutes for my online order after being notified within 10 minutes of placing said order that it was ready to be picked up. When I arrived at the location, there were about 5 people waiting for their online orders. I had no problem waiting initially because I saw that they were really busy with the long line of people that were coming in to order. After about 20 minutes of waiting, I decided to go into the walk-in line and see if I could get some help there. I showed the very robotic employee my Uber screen and told her I had been waiting awhile and gave her my name so I could get some sort of update. She disappeared off to the side where they make the online orders, came back and told me they were working on it. I then went back to the gathering of us forgotten online order sheeple. The thing that irritated me the most about this entire experience is that even with the large number of online order people waiting, not one employee came over to apologize or provide any kind of update whatsoever. They were just operating like a bunch of robots on an assembly line. I just spent 10 minutes reading previous reviews about this Chipotle location and apparently this problem has been going on for well over a year and no one seems to give a shit. Where is management? Is there management? This location is a waste of space and should be closed if they don't care about it's day to day operations. This is unacceptable. This location is just a poorly run shit show with a bunch of incompetent kids on the stage. Do better or close your doors. Pathetic.",-0.975
"DO NOT GO HERE!!! I rarely write a yelp review but, this place fucked up so much. That I had to warn others. 

They wrapped my buddy's burrito so poorly that it was essentially a blob when he opened it 1 min after getting it. 

They confused my order qoth someone else's and I didnt think to check it. I got a chicken bowl and I ended up with a steak bowl. They employees seem like they are legitimately stupid and dont know what the heck is going on. 

Steer clear, and go to any other chipotle unless you you want to pay for something other than you ordered and shoddy service.",-0.8916

Ordered two margaritas one with an extra shot of tequila. Drinks were brought out the drinks and we asked which was which she said she didn't know, taste it , laughed and said have a good night so then we asked to speak with the manager and she was the manager. 2nd  my food came out I ordered nachos it was burnt to a crisp and smelt like char I asked the waitress if this is what it was supposed to look like and she turned up her face.

So, we walked out to the bar and found three empty chairs (among many) but were told the were reserved or that they were not six feet distanced. They most definitely were but the bartender saw us trying to sit and immediately bowed up at us. Literally ""bowed.""  He was so incredibly rude and his demeanor was extremely confrontational. It was embarrassing how badly we were treated in such a short amount of time. 
His name was Josh.",-0.9162

To continue the stellar 1 Star experience, I asked for an extra side of salsa and it took over 15 minutes for him to bring it to us, during the time he was chatting at another guests table (attractive lady).

There's a line up of burritos and bowls just sitting there with no one doing anything to them. Food sits out there in the open getting cold while the customer waits for someone to show up. Either there's no one there to scoop the toppings or no one is at the cashier. Whether there's 3 or 30 people in line the service is slow slow slow. By far my least favorite location to come to.",-0.9104
"This chipotle is horrible. Yelp should let you give zero stars. I had a vegetarian rice bowl. The brown rice was NOT cooked, I'm talking crunchy. They put a tiny amount of beans, an enormous amount of salsa, and their lettuce was brown. Yes, brown lettuce. I got a side of guacamole. I found the core from a head of lettuce in my cup of guac- why?! The queso was COLD, the chips were old. The counter they were sliding the orders down on was gross and spoiled with food that had missed each order. Beware if you stop here to eat. Don't do it.",-0.8221

"Can I give it zero stars? One is ten times too many for this place. Went in at 3:30p wanting to try this place for Mexican food. The chips and salsa came from a can (big chunks with a tomato paste consistency), definitely not homemade, but he also didn't offer to do anything about it. I showed our server and asked if it came from a jar or can but he pleaded ignorance. When asked what I should try on the menu I was told the ""Bad Juan"". I asked if this was a restaurant or a bar that serves food. He hesitated to answer. I asked if the tortillas were homemade but he didn't know that either. We paid our tab for the overly strong ""weak"" version of the Bad Juan and left in search of real Mexican food. 
TL;DR avoid this place. Not authentic and crappy service.",-0.8524

I asked for a bowl and it was filled a half inch, the lady gave me literally a pinch of cheese and it was so noticeable how stingy she was being that the woman next to me said ""that's it?"" The lady then rolled her eyes and said what else? I feel it's getting worse here though because there wasn't any Utensils out and when we all were asking for them they just shrugged us off and gave us smirks as in ""you all can wait"" meanwhile we just paid for our food and waited 12 minutes so we can eat the food.

Everything seems to be way off the mark, from the usually astute and reliable service (all new faces), to the most important factor...the food! Burritos were dry, over cooked, and simply thrown onto a plate. Hastily and carelessly put toghther. No longer worth the premium price. It seems that they've started to cut corners, which certainly shows. Don't waste your money or your time.",-0.1197

The food, the worst ever, first of all we ordered the guacamole , it was very spicy but no salt or any other flavor and the salsa also had no flavor. I ordered the sirloin and chicken tacos, the sirloin was uneatable, I had a problem to swallow the first bite from the bad taste, the chicken tacos was eatable but no taste, no flavor.

"This was a regular spot for our group of friends, but tonight has completely changed minds. We waited for about an hour and then the hostesses finally sat us after we had to remind them 3 times that we were waiting for our table. We received a text our table was ready and when we spoke to the hostess we realized they had given the table to another group. After two more reminders  we were finally seated and of course, the waitress spilled salsa all over my friend's back. She unapologetically brought a glass of soda water and said ""this should help."" On top of the terrible service, the cheese quesadilla, that my vegetarian friend ordered, was a chicken quesadilla. I used to be a regular but tonight ruined it for me. The waitstaff takes themselves way too seriously and I am not quite sure why.",-0.3222
"Had high hopes because of reviews, but I should of just stuck with the theory that ""people usually don't have good idea of what good food really is"". This place is wayyyyy overpriced and their food is horrid.

The Chicken and Steak burrito without sauce was meh! Comes with nothing. Gf and me had lunch and spent $37 on two things and minor appetizer. Looking down on the receipt was a tip line! Never go places like this and certainly do not tip. They get paid straight wages. 

I gave it two stars for being clean. 

The sauces they have for mole sauce is disgusting! Tastes like burnt chocolate. 

Never going back. Moe's is much better. I am not much for corporate businesses I like local but these guys need a lesson in authentic food. If your ingredients is not imported from Mexico it's not authentic. It's just crap.
They will not make it in this economy with those prices and business model.

Wow.",-0.8766
"WHAT A NIGHTMARE!  Went here on Cinco de Mayo hoping for some great authentic Mexican food and Margarita's - what a mistake.  You would think that of all days to be on their game this would be it.  Cinco de Mayo is like the Black Friday of the Mexican restaurant.  We ordered food and drinks all at the same time thinking it might be busy in the kitchen.  It took 45 minutes and multiple requests to get our drinks from the bar - which didn't have a drop of alcohol in them.  Our food came out in 4 shifts, after having to tell the waiter every time we saw him that we were still missing meals.  -May I add, that after looking around we realized that the restaurant was far from being packed.  Many tables were open.  So, no excuses as to how busy they were.-   The food that did come out was NOT good.  My nachos were like goulash. I had to eat them with a fork and after 3 bites, I couldn't eat any more. Ugh!  After 2 and a half hours of telling the waiter we were still waiting on our friend's Fajitas, we said cancel the order and give us the checks so we can leave.  After 20 more minutes they bring out our checks, and his fajitas.  At that point that was an insult.  Not to mention, there was an extra meal and drink from the bar on our check that no one at our table even ordered.  After all was said and done, my husband and I paid $33 some odd dollars for 2 horrible meals and a sweet tea.  SO NOT WORTH IT!  We were not alone in this nightmare, either.  As we left we saw multiple table disputing charges on their checks and getting frustrated with the wait staff.  To top it off, half way through our time there, drinks started coming to tables in red plastic cups.  Really?  A restaurant that ran out of real glasses? What a joke!  Take it from me when I say - DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME HERE!  We went straight to Chili's after leaving and got great Fajitas and Margarita's in a timely manner with  great service!  should've gone there to begin with. *I did not want to give it even 1 star,  zero stars is what this place deserves.*",-0.6546

So we walk in and the sign says ""open seating"" and the girl says anyone else coming in and my wife said no. She said, ""can you move over to this table then!"" There was no else in the restaurant so I don't understand her need for her rudeness. Then she asks us what do we want to drink and my wife says water with lemon and I was about to say horchata and walks away with a sighing! So I didn't even get the chance to order my drink. I told my wife let's get up and go! Nobody notices! First time visiting and will never return back!",-0.9333
"I would no star this place if I could. I didn't think it was possible to make a bad burrito, kudos it was awful. The black beans there are not refried, they just serve black beans. Worst Mexican food I've ever had. I just ordered a margarita, thank god without salt, and it was a glass full of green sugar. I'm not sure if this is normal but all the music regardless of the type was blended together to a dance beat, just annoying. The service really not worth mentioning other than the man with the beard that greeted us, he was great. I have no clue what this place is going for and not going back anytime soon.",-0.44

"This is probably the worst Chili's I've been to.  The bad part is, it is the closest one to my house.  Over the past year or two, it has really declined.  Went for dinner and sat in a booth that is in the bar area.  It was early (5:00ish) so it was empty.  Most of the tables needed wiping down.  We sat down and all our menu's were covered in salsa.  The window had a large splat of ketchup?  There was salsa all over the window ledge.  We told the waitress, but she didn't seem to care because she didn't get a towel to clean it up.  The only thing the female manager and employees cared about during this time was making all their employees drinks that were heading out to a baseball game.

We knew what we wanted to order so we ordered promptly.  She said our salads would be right out.  Well, no they weren't.  We waited quite a while.  During our wait a man with kids sat in a booth behind us.  He was ignored by the waitress for so long that he packed up his three young kids and left.  That table was also dirty and remained that way during our entire stay.  

Our salads came out and shortly after that our burgers came.  Our waitress was basically invisible to us, so once we caught her eye we asked for our bill.  That proved to be another challenge because she had taken the battery out of that device that they put on your table.  So again we waiting for a new battery, then for it to reboot so we can pay.  Once we paid, our device had no paper, so we couldn't get a receipt.  No biggie.

The female manager came around and we let her know how dirty everything was and how long it had been like that.  Also let her know customers left.  Her only excuse was that the waitress was by herself.  It was empty when we got there and it was the same waitress.  The only thing we could figure out was that if the table stayed dirty, no one would sit there and that was what the waitress wanted.  The manager made no apologies, nor did she make any attempt to clean the mess anywhere.

I hope this Chili's closes and something good goes in there.  We have enough Chili's in the area that are clean and give good service.",-0.6466
"I love Chipotle and have been to many different locations and they've all been great except this one. It just has a very sad ambiance. I don't really know why. Maybe that's why I never see people inside - granted, I've only been to this one 2 times but theyve both been during peak lunch hours and Ive always been the only one there. It's awkward. And for some reason, the food at this Chipotle just tastes a little sadder and looks a little smaller than it does at its other locations.",-0.3832
"Food was ok. Hair in tacos, had to send back. Still charged for it. Also charged $.99  fee for table entertainment-using tablet that was on the table. We were not aware of this fee ahead of time.  Overall disappointing meal",-0.5574
"I was served bad shrimp. Hey, it happens. What doesnt happen is I'm charged anyway and told to ask the manager to remove it. Yeah right. $50.00 tab later I've eaten my moms salmon and I'm fired up. Won't be back sadly. The manager was so sweet too, of course he didn't witness what his buffoon bar server told me. I hope he ate the shrimp in the back and got a bad case of the chimichurris! I drove so far for disappointment and possible sickness!",-0.7391
"Please fire your drive through attendant asap.  Worst customer service I've ever seen. She gave me a Sprite that was out of syrup.  When I asked if I could get another made she told me ""no pick another drink because she couldnt take other orders while changing out the drink syrup"".  It wasnt even the fact that she wouldn't do it she had a horrible attitude like I ruined her day by asking for a new drink.  I'll never buy from here again.",-0.8885

Total for a salad...$15.58..Wow!.. that's alot for a SMALL salad that was mostly lettuce...big disappointment and won't be going back anytime soon..",-0.6212

"I was so excited that a Chipotle was opening up, so my friends and I were so disappointed at our first visit around the time of their opening. Skimpy portions and it seemed very chaotic. Line was huge, people were so slow and everyone was asking for more of this, more of that. We decided it was maybe because they were still training etc.... Unfortunately, my friend and I visited this location again with not only the same situation as before, but now they have rude individuals dishing out our meager rations. We overheard the, I'm assuming, manager(heavy set with curly hair), cussing at her employees while others around her laughed and its no wonder everyone is in such a bad mood! I feel sorry for her minions and hope corporate takes a look at who is running their business before they ruin it. The gentlman ahead of us noticed as well and he had to ask for more meat like 3 times stating he would even pay for it. It was uncomfortable and I definitely won't be back. I'd prefer to go to the one on MacDill where I can relax and get what I pay for.",-0.2917
"Food is not good and overpriced. We had fajitas ($17.50) and basically got Walmart tortilla shells and bland meat . Poor service and disgusting bathroom.",-0.8362
"Live roach. Ew. 

Went in for takeout one evening and had to wait a bit. Normally we would order and immediately take a seat, or our takeout would be ready upon arrival, but not this evening. 
Since I had some extra time, I started peering over into the servers workstation, which was completely disheveled.  I am a stickler for absolute cleanliness. So, this made me feel uneasy.  Started gazing at the floor, as the doorway to the kitchen area has space that allows you to see into the kitchen. I noticed a food bin placed directly onto the floor = health code violation. 
This made me more uneasy. 

So I continued staring at the food bin deciding if I should even be eating here at this point, when I noticed a roach crawling by it. NICE!  I quietly advised the cashier that I would like to cancel my order and requested a refund. She asked why, and I let her know exactly what I saw. She merely said ""oh, ok"" and refunded my money.  There was no concern at any point nor any attempt at redemption.  That's the most worrisome part. As a food professional, I know there aren't excuses for pests in a food establishment and it can be avoided with proper cleaning and maintenance.  Even in Florida. 
If there are live roaches coming out in the middle of a busy service, I imagine the problems are much worse. 

This used to be my fave place for seemingly fresh Mexican food, same for my boyfriend.  Service was typically above average and the manager knew us by name after a while. The lack of concern for why I will never return, is absolutely unnerving.  

When you have a professional kitchen, it's not a choice, but a responsibility to serve fresh food in a clean environment. 

I'll never return.",-0.8602

Also the girl on the grill grabs all meat with one hand and meat is cross contaminated with other meats. If you have a meat allergy don't go because you will get sick. Seafood, beef, pork and chicken are in bins and you minus well put it in one bowl.",-0.3384
"Awful service. Food took over an hour to arrive. When it did, it was all wrong. What was worse about this experience was the attitude of management. No apologies were offered - in fact, the Manager there was annoyed that we had questioned the delay. She was extremely rude and because of her, my friends and I will never return. They compensated my meal which was completely wrong but didn't offer any other compensations considering my friends had wrong food items and we had waited for so long. They weren't busy enough to warrant such terrible and rude service, mistakes or delays. I'd highly consider replacing your Management with people who care about business and service. We all come from hospitality backgrounds and were floored by the level of service here.",-0.9519
"We have been to the Green Lemon several times and have noticed a decline in service as well as the food. Tonight we received a dirty plate and silverware which was disgusting. We ordered our appetizer and not even 10 minutes later our entrees were delivered.  We weren't finished with our appetizer and felt as if we were being rushed through our dinner. We didn't receive our full entrée and waited an additional 10 minutes until our side dish was served. The whole time we watched a young man who was highly intoxicated act inappropriately and we were very surprised that he was served any more drinks. We were underwhelmed by our entrées and won't be back.",-0.4601
"Ordered a cheese quesadilla and they delivered me a tortilla with in a box with no cheese.  I don't recommend going to this location. Plus it's the slowest chipotle I've been to.",-0.5122
"Staff working tonight were completely incompetent. It took me close to 20 minutes to make it through the line with ONLY FOUR customers in line. Standing there. JUST STANDING THERE. The woman working was unable to take simple direction. I asked for double protein and she looked at me, dumbfounded. I asked for lite sour cream, SHE FILLED THE ENTIRE SPOON WITH SOUR CREAM AND PROCEEDED TO DROWN THE BOWL. The other employees were not any better. Some guests were wrongfully charged for avocado. Others just stood in awe at the service. They were unable to wrap burritos. Stuff falling out of the side. Line was understocked -- empty 1/3 pans. AND TALK ABOUT FILTH. The expo line was TRASHED. THERE WERE FOUR PEOPLE IN LINE. 

One employee, a man from New York came up from the back and tried to salvage the situation. By this point the damage was done.

I was unable to eat Dinner tonight. Thanks Chipotle.",-0.9463
"Let me start out by saying I loooove chipotle. I used to eat chipotle at least 3 times a week. However, now that I moved, this is the closest chipotle to me and my visits have decreased to about once a month because of the service at this location and me not wanting to drive farther. Here are a few examples why. On one incident, the guy toasted my tortilla for way too long (and I knew it was going to be hard as a rock) because he was talking to his coworker. I politely asked for a new tortilla and this request seemed to be the biggest inconvenience in the world. Another time, the line was insanely long, all the way past the entrance doors. When I got to the front of the line the employees were joking around with who should roll the burritos and we're throwing the pieces of meat that fell out of the burritos at each other. My most recent experience, once again the line was insanely long and two employees were standing behind the food making line just watching two other employees do all the hard work. Meanwhile, there were no forks for people to use to eat...",-0.5574
"I've been a very loyal Chipotle customer in the Tampa Bay Area frequenting the Westshore Blvd. and Howard Ave locations. 

I was so excited when the Gandy location opened by my house. I've been to this Chipotle 5-10 times since opening and this location is by far the worst I've ever been to. 

I really hope management sees this and steps in to give this team some training. 

There are some pleasant staffers but for the most part their young, immature, and talk amongst themselves. Did it become a crime to talk to your customers?.... The staff at the Westshore location is great! Go visit them and take some notes. 

Secondly, every time I've been there they are out of something. Salad dressing, guacamole, lettuce..... I get it from time to time but every time? 

I go to this location out of extreme desperation for something quick and it's a disappointment every time. 

Such a shame because overall I really love this brand.",-0.2872
"If zero stars was an option, that would be more appropriate. I will never dine at this establishment again. Although one horrible employee should not make me feel so strongly about a place, the lack of action of empathy from the manager standing nearby was disgusting. A friend wanted to dine here after a workout and I was not going to eat, but stood in line with him. He had a tee shirt on with information the customer behind him questioned as he approached the order taker. No fault of his own he was distracted and the order taker begin to yell at him! I stepped him and told him I would pay for his food anywhere else before allowing him to pay for this incompetence. I asked who the manager on duty was, and to my surprise it was the submissive male employee who witnessed everything yet said/did nothing. I will never dine here again",-0.9608

"Can you give 0 stars??  We had a simple request - 2 chicken burritos.  We went through DoorStep Delivery (never had an issue, extremely helpful and kind) and received one beef burrito.  Not only did we not order this, they were extremely rude to the Doorstep Delivery person. who tried to fix the issue.  So, I call Estela's and the manager tells me there is nothing they can do. Really?  We paid extra for chicken.  Ordered 2 burritos - received one.  Screw this place.  60 later, I have inedible food (their ground meat is true dog food...).  How many nights do wish you were going to Taco Bell? It's THAT bad! Stay the hell away from here.",-0.7545

"I love Chipotle, but the restaurant on West Gandy is just sub-par on service. I have been short-served several times. The bins are always awaiting somerthing to get cooked that stalls the line. Finally tonight I spoke up when the server dash a half spoon of rice and a half spoon of beans because the bin was empty. She  then pushed my bowl to the toppings area before I could ask for grilled peppers.  Several other people also protested about similar treatment. I do not have this issue at Westshore and North Dale Mabry locations. The staff at the Gandy location are close to rude.  I do not see this location lasting since word is spreading about the poor service and ""short-serving"". Several customers and I will not eat there again. Not worth the drama when Chick-a-fil is 100ft away and the staff is actually grateful you are in their restaurant.",-0.7579
"Haven't been to Chipotle  in a while but don't remember it like this location. The food was decent. The steak was luke warm and dry. And too much cilantro. My son's meal had almost no food on it . It had 1 or 1/2 a quesadilla, a disgusting brown orange fruit, and cold rice. My food was ok just hanging all off the plate like they were in a hurry but the funny thing was I was the only person in line so maybe if they took there time instead of trying to get in on the conversation of their friends my food would have looked better.  Next when we got the the main table in the front was full of lettuce and cheese and needed to be wiped off. Next when in line we couldn't hear the woman who was speaking to us because all of her co-workers  were talking about axe murderers and killing and what they were going to do this weekend . My family and I had to wait til they were done talking to hear the one taking our order. Next I know it's not the biggest deal ever but the teas were labeled wrong . Also I know trash smells but either the trash smelled like vomit or the soda machine needed cleaned cause it smelled so bad. Next was the dinning area, and holy cow trash was littered everywhere, chips and garbage all over the floor and tables. I had to clean off my table to sit at it. During the cleaning of my table there was an employee not on her break because she had her phone plugged in and playing on it and texting.  All in all I don't think I could come back here too many negatives and it was just a disgusting restaurant and I couldn't recommend  people coming here.  I already told a few not to go there.",-0.9778

The restaurant was messy: unclean tables; fountain drinks area full of ice everywhere; plastic ware containers were empty and a lot of spills and garbage around the area.
When I asked the cashier for plastic ware; she replenished the containers but did not clean the area and had an overload of plastic ware.
We ordered a cheese quesadilla and were told that they are not allow to cut it up anymore, never hear about it.
The chicken bowl was not tasty.",-0.8505
"First, we love Chipotle for its simple, but tasty menu and fast casual atmosphere. However, our experience today was a complete disappointment and turnoff of this chain. This Restauant was absolutely filthy. There was not a clean table in the entire place and the restaurant was only 20% occupied and not busy. The counter staff were not on point and the cashier messed up our entire order. Our two kids meals were put on one tray and we had to ask for the drink and then go back up after to ask for the included chips. We asked for a manager, who corrected the issue with the kids meals, but did nothing for the cleanliness of the place after. All of the tables remained dirty and littered with food crumbs, smears of sour cream and trash. We were not impressed with this Chipotle experience and we will consider other lunch options in the future. Disappointed...",-0.9302
"The service at this location is consistently slow and the food served lukewarm.   I have been here at least a half-dozen times in the last 10 months and have never been impressed.  My major annoyance this time was that my daughter (ordering off the kid's menu) wanted the little cheeseburgers and Mac & cheese.  I was told that she can't get the mac & cheese as a side and that I would have to be charged for an entire second kid's meal. Seriously?  That is just total inflexibility with the menu and complete lack of customer care.  I certainly don't plan to be back there anytime soon.",-0.4685

A few days ago I was told they were out of white rice (AFTER i waited in the long dinner line) and that it would be minimum 30 minutes for more! What kind if management allows the restaurant to get that low on an ingredient most customers have before preparing more?? They've run out of chicken at this location also. And it happens too frequently. I hate that there is not a different location close to me.",-0.9213
"I won't be coming here anytime soon. The food tastes like if they reheated with the microwave. My wife ordered a steak burrito and there was no steak on it. The  burrito didn't come with a side so we ordered some fries which they charge us $5.00 dollars. I ordered the south of the border chicken and it was just a small chicken breast covered with cheese and chopped tomatoes. The refried beans you can tell just by looking at them that we're reheated with the microwave and didn't we're fresh at all. The place is good to have a few beers and have some chicken wings but other than that the food sucks.",-0.3881
"The workers are rude as hell.  The portions of foods they give are for 5 years kids to eat.  No smiles.  And to top it off omg the food was old and no fresh. Tofu was not fresh, the lettuce was dark, and.the chips are stale.  WORST CHIPOTLE EVER.  OWNER needs to do something quick.",-0.8531
"My burrito swam in watered down bbq sauce and was cut with some kind of bad tabasco sauce.  Inside was the sloppy battle of putrid refried beans, sour cream, undercooked rice, and something I think might have been under reconstituted protein powder.

The tacos weren't as bad, but cilantro isn't lettuce, especially when it's by itself.  My fish tacos was watery and fell apart.  It had no flavor or zip.  In retrospect they should just call their tacos cilantro tacos and never mind with a protein.

Too bad, inside is nice.",-0.8868
"If I could give less stars I would. The fish tacos had no flavor grilled on one side and left the tortilla soggy. The shredded lettuce had a old smell to it.

We get the basics and usually don't have any issues. 
This time was different, I ordered my usual and so did my partner. We get the meals and slowly started to picked at it.  During my second bite of the yellow rice I realized it smelled off. I know rice because it's a staple diet.  I know what bad rice smells like as well. This was spoiled rice.  So we notified our server and he went to the back and notified the ""cook"" and came back after a minute and said the team in the back tried it and it was ""fine"". (Lie #1) it was not fine. When a customer tell you something is bad, the manager should immediately intervene. That never happened. Then I was told it was ""new"" rice that they just started using. (Lie #2) They ended up serving me spoiled rice that common people wouldn't catch on to. I would never come to this establishment ever and would highly recommend everyone pay attention to the quality of the food being served to you.",-0.4334

I stood there for four and a half minutes while two people flirted while the big fat guy sliced steak. One of the employees eating in the lobby was conversing with the girl with the nose ring.  She completely ignored me the entire time. I turned and walked out and will take my business elsewhere. No sense of urgency, no hello, no acknowledgement that THERE are customers in the store. Pathetic. I won't go back.",-0.9216

It's pricey for what it is: Mediocre Mexican food.

I was excited to see sofritas offered as a burrito bowl choice, however, the service ruined the meal for me. The servers working the line were full of piss and vinegar which is not the kind of toppings I normally order with my burrito bowl. After served attitude, I brought it to the attention of the manager who seemed less than apologetic.

Dining room had trash all over the floor and every table had crumbs on it. Poor management and the culture needs some revision. Team members are not engaged and here to just punch in and punch out.

I told them that this restaurant had great reviews so let's go grab a late lunch. They both got the chicken burritos and later on that day my mom was starting to feel very sick. Come to find out it was food poisoning. She did mention to me that something in the sauce just didn't taste right and since we had never eaten in there before we just though that maybe that was what is was supposed to taste like.

Now I'm sure he won't last long there so this may not apply in the future. This guy has no service skills whatsoever. Pal hates his job and it clearly shows. He was rude and unhelpful. I actually got up and left, went next door to a McD and the high school girls at the drive through window could have taught him how to greet a customer, be polite and friendly. That's the basics in the service industry, sadly HR for Chili's failed here and their brand suffers.",-0.8779
"The WORST Taco Bell experience I've had! It took 20 minutes to get 3 AM crunch wraps and an iced coffee. The little girl at the register was complaining that customers were going through the drive-thru, which was supposed to be closed, but there was nothing that indicated it was closed. No sign, no orange cone, nothing. This place was a nightmare! Rude, incompetent staff.

First, I ordered there food and before we could order ours, the rude lady went to the next person as if we didn't exist. So we patiently wait and after she was done with the woman, we told her we weren't done ordering. So she took out order and passed it to a man to finish us up. Was told the kids get 3 sides...but then gave us two choices and that was it. As I was telling her the guy what I would like on mine, I told him ""lettuce, cheese, and salsa"" and before I could finish he passed it to the register. I was not done!!! I just went with it because I don't like to cause drama but NEVER will I come again. The food was okay but the service was beyond unacceptable. Never again.",-0.4635

  I was very disappointed as I could find very little chicken in my chicken burrito.  No wonder it was on sale for 5.50 during happy hour.  They made up for the discount by loading the burrito with lots of rice and cilantro, and leaving me with minute amounts of chicken.  The cilantro was overwhelming and dominated the bad taste of my burrito.  The burrito was also cold.

  The chips and salsa was also bad as the homemade salsa was bland and the chips looked like they were smashed by into little pieces by a hammer.  The best part of the meal was the mango unsweetened tea.",-0.3797
"I ate at this location several times over the last month. Each time there was an issue with the portion size being smaller than what it's supposed to be like half a scoop of chicken. Tonight's experience was the worse. I ordered my bowl and the employee sprinkled rice into the bowl. I tried asking for more rice, but was not heard and they proceed with adding the beans and chicken. I then requested for more rice on the side and was given a small scoop in a guacamole/sauce cup. 

I proceeded to go back to the hotel that is a block away and took a bite. I noticed my bite was cold and thought it was a bite of salsa. Nope. The entire bowl was cold. Ended up eating about half and couldn't stomach the rest because of Chipotles history of making people sick.",-0.8126

I have ordered this drink the same way here every time that I have come to eat and never has it been such a hassle. My main meal that came out was also the size of an appetizer and disgusting that I didn't even want to feed it to my dogs. The manager when he came to speak with me told me that he is here for me and not to rip me off but couldn't explain how my drink items kept going up in price. A place I used to frequent once a week, I will never go to again after tonight's experience.",-0.1682
"Really disappointed in our first experience. We walked in at around 3pm on a Saturday. It was jam packed so we figured it had to be good. 20 min go by and no one came for our drink order. We waved the gal down and ordered water and 10 min later we still had no water. My husband and I were about to leave when she brought some chips. We finally got drinks after waving someone down a third time. We ordered guacamole and cheese dip and after 15 min the waitress came over to apologize saying there was a huge party the next day and therefore they were busy in the kitchen prepping. She also offered tortillas since they were out of chips. My husband and I kindly asked if we could cancel our orders and leave. If you don't have enough help or have a big event and therefore taking people from the floor to help in the kitchen, close your place or hire temporary help. Several other people were leaving their table as well due to the lack of service and attention. Sorry guys!",-0.6439
"My wife and I decided to try Elsa's as we were in the mood for Mexican and have never been there..  We walked in this past Sunday afternoon and there were no other diners, only football fans at the bar, as it's also a sports bar. That should have been a sign. They have a nice menu and since I love Chimichangas and they have 4 on the menu I ordered the shredded beef chimichanga and my wife ordered the seafood.  I have had chimichangas at many restaurants in the Tampa bay area and in Texas and Arizona and know that they are deep fried and should be crispy. I give this place 1 star because we had 3 separate servers including the manager but the chimichangas (we both ordered a chimichanga) were horrible and not even worth 1 star.  Ours were both  beyond soft; they were actually mushy.  I alerted the manager to this and she said that is normal because they deep fry it and then add a small amount of sauce and cheese to the top and bake it implying the sauce made it mushy.  There was no sauce on the ends and it was mushy there too. She said matter of factly that the sauce makes it soggy as if that were normal for a chimichanga  She did offer to try to make another but my thoughts were- what would the cook do to it as payback for my complaint and why not make it right the first time if they knew how to make it right.  What a waste of $30!!!

I did suggest that if they are going to put the sauce and cheese on then put it on the side and keep it crispy as all chimichangas shoud be.  A mushy chimichanga is extremely gross and if they continue to cook it this way then I would say avoid this place.  We would go back if they would learn how to cook it right as the shredded beef had an interestingly spicy flavor and the seafood, though sparse, was not too bad (she would not reorder the seafood though)",-0.9142
"Since I work at the hospital, I decided to give this place a try.  There were 2 girls talking to each other when I walked in, and one other customer.  It took them a while to finish their conversation, and give me a menu.  I ordered the seafood soup to go, and was severely disappointed.  If it hadn't been raining when I got home, I would have driven right back with it.  The broth was salty and overly spicy, and the calamari in it was boot leather tough.  I was extremely disappointed, as I moved here from Texas, and would love to find a good Mexican restaurant close by.",-0.3818
"Worst chipotle around. Service is the worst. Took me 20 minutes today with 3 people in front of me in line at 2:00pm (not a busy time). I saw one of the cooks touching the food with no gloves on. Absolutely gross. I asked for double rice and the lady working had a bad attitude about it. It was evident that everything else she did was with an attitude. I've been here multiple times and this will be the last time. Every time makes me not want chipotle but I eat it 3-4 times a week. Don't go here.",-0.8503
"I love Mexican food. But the food here was mediocre at best. Decent (as in it didn't make me sick) food, smelled & looked good but the taste was bland and the rice was mushy. But that was all great until the service. The waitress was HORRIBLE. She didn't even bring us menus... we had to get our own. We waited 15 minutes for our drinks just for her to come back and tell me they don't have mojitos. So I ordered a bloody Mary which didn't have a garnish & their ""homemade bloody Mary mix"" was nothing more than watered down tomato juice. We waited a good 45 minutes for our food, which I had to remind her that we were still waiting for. She brought it and it had CLEARLY been sitting in the window for a while because the queso had developed a film. At that time (upon looking at my half drunk horrible bloody Mary) told me that they now have mojitos. I was shocked. I ordered one anyways which was clearly a mistake because it was no more than a rum soda with a few floating chunks of mint. I frequent Davis Island and this was a horrible dining experience. Without a doubt I will never be back.",-0.817
"Rating based solely on staff, not food we never got the chance to eat. Tuesday night, called and asked if there was a wait, ""no, not yet"". ""Great, we'll be there soon."" We live in South Tampa and were there in less than 10 minutes. Once there, the hostess said there was a 40 minute wait. When looking around, there was no one waiting for tables and at least 4 tables empty and set ready to seat people. Terrible service and lost our business. Our family does Taco Tuesday around the bay every week and we've been to 36 places so far. This is by far the worst and we will not return.",-0.8943
"Sad to say my fav Mexican restaurant just hit bottom.  I order the same dish every time I come and the bring my plate out with a burrito instead on an enchilada.  I ask if the could correct the very obvious mistake. She said she would be right back.  Came back to the table twice finally I had to ask again if she was gonna bring an enchilada so she took my plate to the back and come back saying this is an Enchilada....nope I am not stupid I know the difference. Not even an apology or can I make it different for you.  Sad to say Miguel's I'm coming back to you for my Mexican food.",-0.5024
"Worst experience ever. The food is cold and old. The people were so rude and I couldn't get over how disgusting the food was. Taco Bell is a Million times better. Don't waste your money on this place!!!!",-0.852
"The food has gone down hill and that is why I am writing a negative review so the owners/managers can make some changes for customers to come back....

We ordered 2 orders of ""3 Hard Taco's"" and the shells were Stale and not crunchy. The ground beef tasted like Pure Salt and could not take another bite..  Plus Taco's only come with your choice of meat, sour cream, and cheese... Very Plain! 

Ordered Queso Blanco as an appetizer.. Had no taste to it and the cheese got hard after 5 minutes.  Will not be coming back to Elsa's for a long time.. Very disappointing!!",-0.8614
"Every time I've been to this particular Chipotle I see a bunch of employees laying round and actually two or three people working. The lines are alway long and by the time I pay my food is already cold. It's also one of the dirtiest restaurants. Poor management!",-0.8016
"Food wasn't awful, but the service was terrible. Won't return. Far better Mexican in Tampa to frequent.",-0.7593
"We were visiting friends in Tampa. They had heard about this place so we went.
When our waiter finally came to our table, he assured us he could give us his undivided attention since all his other tables were done. If that was undivided attention, I'll pass. Our order came out in shifts, so everyone didn't eat at the same time. Then the kicker....we ordered a pitcher of Sangria. It came out and tasted awful.  I asked what type of liquor was added to the wine to make it taste so odd. The waiter told me they add vodka to the wine. Then he proceeded to say that was the way it was supposed to be. I have never heard of adding vodka to sangria. Even though he knew we didn't like the wine, he never tried to fix the problem. They charge 32.00 for a pitcher of sangria. When the food did arrive, it was okay, nothing out of this world.
Would not return due to the overall lack of concern for a customer's satisfaction.",-0.4022
"For the love all things holy can we please get someone from cooperate to come down here and fire everyone, and start from scratch. This place is the worst chipotle I've ever been to. I used to come here 5 days a week and somewhere along the line everyone who made the experience  so great left and they replaced them with the bench warmers. Everyone moped around and every single time I've come here in the last month they are out of something. I want to clarify I hate writing reviews, Infact I hate them so much this is my first ever online review. The only thing I hate more than writing reviews is what the gandy chipotle is doing to my love of chipotle. I thought the point of corporate cookie cutter restaurants is to have them all the be the same. I appreciate you guys keeping up with the ugly step child you call Gandy Chipotle, my dinners have been ruined and my love of the chipotle but a candle in the wind. I would have given it negative stars if that was possible. Sincerely everyone who has eaten here in the last 3 months!",-0.1584
"This chipotle is without a doubt the worst chipotle I've ever been too. A male who took cashed me out was beyond rude to me and multiple other customers and was not completing orders. Two customers became so impatient with staff they left the business. Manager on duty did not do anything to resolve these issues himself which was disappointing. Overall terrible experience and the food was sub par to say the least. If I could give less than one star I would. Save the troubles go somewhere else.",-0.6075
"What happened??? The food has changed for the worse. 
The Plantain Nachos didn't have the same awesomeness at all.  The pork tacos were pathetic and nasty greasy with minimal filling 

This used to be a wonderful treat and worth the long drive down too. 
So sad this has happened.",-0.7925
"Had a great birthday group only to have the worst service. Couldn't get food. Couldn't figure out our bills. No apologies.  No compensation for poor service and cold food.",-0.7579
"I have been a fan of The Green Lemon for the last two years. I recently realized the entire staff is a pretentious bunch of immature, unprofessional, and rude assholes. My last experience at the restaurant was beyond terrible. I ordered a margarita with salt, got a margarita without salt--easy fix, right? However when informed the waitress (long brown hair wearing a black hat), she took up an extreme attitude with me and didn't even apologize for the mistake. I have been a waitress for over 6 years and always apologize for mistakes--whether or not it is my fault, that's just what you do in the food industry. She rushed over to the bar and my boyfriend and I watched her salt a new glass and pour the first drink into it. She slammed the ""new glass"" on the table. It was literally salted ever so slightly on half the side of the rim, so carelessly--like come on take some pride in your work? I then walked up to the bar--clearly our waitress was incompetent. They made me a new one and said my waitress would bring it over. She proceeded to practically through the glass at me and tossed a FULL SALT SHAKER as well! She was condescending, bitchy, and completely rude. It was alarming how unprofessional she acted--WOW. I asked to speak to the manager, a young male, he ""attempted"" to make the situation ""better,"" only to act as a catalyst to the already escalated situation. Another extremely unprofessional individual that clearly does not belong in the food industry--especially not restaurant management. Listen, if you want to be treated like less than a human go to The Green Lemon--they will make sure to approach you with a condescending, rude, and completely unprofessional attitude. Advice: If your a ""urban Mexican restaurant"" figure out how to put salt on the rims of your glasses, it is NOT rocket science. Also, employ young professionals, NOT stuck up and immature individuals that get off on blaming customers for their own mistakes. A solid round of applause would like to be given to the absolute lack of management at this establishment--deplorable.",-0.9836
"My family would pass another chili's to eat at this location, but we will be rethinking that. Food was decent enough: 2 salads and a steak for lunch. Only complaint was the terrible service. I'm not sure of our server's name because of how much of a stranger he was, but he was the grey-haired bartender. 

We sat ourselves in the bar area and were greeted promptly enough. We ordered drinks and food at the same time, and while every other table had chips and salsa, we were not offered any, and we waited about 15 until I had to flag him down and ask. We then waited several more minutes and didn't receive them until right before our meal came out.

We were never asked if everything looked okay or if we needed anything else (my sister and I ended up needing extra sides of ranch) but he was back behind the bar. It almost seemed like he was trying to avoid serving us. I finally made eye contact with him halfway through the meal and raised my hand and smiled as if to communicate ""hey I need something but don't want to yell across the room to you"" but he proceeded to give a few guys at the bar their checks, and then waited, and then processed their payment instead of seeing what it was that I needed. 

At this point my brother and sister were cringing and telling me to forget, and I would've let it slide but then he started getting a to-go order ready for someone who had just walked in... The meal was basically over at this point but he finally came over and I asked for two sides of ranch which, again, I had to wait longer for, but finally got.

When we were finished, we cleaned up the table and stacked our plates in a neat pile because my sister and I both work in the industry and are very conscious about making things run as smoothly as possible. We sat like that for a while, and a manager had to come by to bus the table for him. We sat with nothing but empty glasses on the table for way too long and for about 5 minutes were the only table in the bar area. Two tables came in and he greeted one, while the manager greeted another. We finally flag him down again and tell him we're ready for a check. He smiles and nods, gets an order from one of the other tables, and disappears into the kitchen...

The reason I asked for a check is because I wanted to pay cash instead of using the tabletop cardswiper. It got to the point where I checked the price of the bill ($34.??) and I ended up throwing $40 on the table and walking out.

I thought about talking to a manager but honestly I felt like an idiot for feeling so disrespected by a stranger for the entire experience. We walked out completely confused and embarrassed. I can only assume he's spent many years serving has left him jaded, and that maybe he has a bias towards younger tables. As a server, I pay attention to little things when I go out to eat, but this was blatantly rude and awkward. 
I do NOT recommend being served by this bizarre bartender.",-0.6355
"If you're from California, don't go here. This place is pretty sub-par Mexican. I guess it is supposed to be more Mexican inspired, than actual Mexican, but whatever--it's just gross.
I should've known better when they only have 1 daily burrito and the waitress said they could not take any of their fajita bowls and make them into burrito form. That's pretty ridiculous.
Tacos I had were bland and boring. Queso was a weird texture and flavor. And chips had some odd seasoning on them.
Don't go here if you're looking for real Mexican.",-0.4331
"This location in Bloomingdale use to be so great when it first opened. The pictures I'm including are the same taco and one from this location and one from another location in St Pete. St pete is also a new location so I hope they don't end up doing the same after awhile. I've had this portion problem with Bloomingdale before and thought I'll give them a second chance. Unfortunately they failed again. Now I do have over 500 points in rewards system so I've spent quite a bit. I'm sorry to say but I don't see this location lasting long. Andre 3000 was the taco.

Josh (owner) before you write a response to this review, maybe think first before you attack the review. After your poor response on google I've read a lot of your 1 star reviews and your comments are always accusing the customer of ordering wrong or not coming to your establishment, bunch of excuses on what really is happening in your store. Maybe think about getting someone else to response to bad reviews as you do a terrible job, which makes sense why your business is also ending up being trash. Do me a favor actually and don't bother responding thanks",-0.9604

Finally someone asked about drinks then we watched again and again as no one attended to us. I was ready to walk out when finally the waiter asked were we ready to order. Not the best Mexican food, but it was edible. We had to ask for napkins and silverware while watching our food get cold and No one ever asked if we wanted anything else to drink. I will definitely NEVER go back!",-0.3348
"My wife and I are big fans of Elsa's Mexican Food.  This afternoon at about noon we went for lunch and had the worst service and food.  Upon arrival we were seated and the host bright chips and salsa.  From there things went down hill.  There were only two other tables with people seated when we arrived.  One family that was leaving and another couple who had not ordered.  So things weren't overly busy.  We sat there for ten minutes before another server asked if we had been helped.  Of course the answer was NO.

Finally our waitress came and took our order.  She brought our drinks and got mine wrong.  I had to find a different server to bring the right drink.

I ordered a shredded chicken chimichunga.   What arrived after a long period of time was shredded beef that was so loaded with salt it was uneatable. 

After about 15 minutes our server came back and asked how our food was.   I explained that she had messed up every part of my order, wrong drink, wrong food and that the food was way over salted.   Her only response was OH.  Not I am sorry or I apologize, just a disinterested OH.  If the place was busy maybe I could understand.  But only 1 other table was occupied",-0.7967
"By far the worst chipotle I have ever been to. I traveled from Chicago to Tampa for the first time to visit family and stopped in for a quick burrito with my girlfriend. She order a burrito bowl with barbocoa and I asked for steak. Her bowl was ready quickly but I was delayed for about 5 minutes my tortilla sat getting soggy with rice and beans setting in. While I waited for steak to be sliced several customers had to mosey past me to complete there orders. When the steak finally came up I received the last greasy,
cold bits of the old bin followed by about a 1/4 spoon of actually fresh meat, which was extremely rare. The manager was quick to take our payment, but not keen enough to notice the person who rolled my burrito spilled nearly half of my salsa and meat onto the counter. I don't like confrontations at restaurants because if I would've said something I would have been irate and lost my temper. If I wanted something vegetarian I could've easily purchased fresh vegetables and rice and cooked them myself. Having previously worked for this chain, not a single aspect of their food line was operating according to company standards and training.",-0.8824

"If you're into all things mediocre (at best), this is the spot for you. My bf and I had capital tacos in land o lakes back in the day and let me tell ya, the comparison was night and day. I suppose they cared about quality before they expanded. 

It wasn't that busy when we went but they were out of most things. No big deal. The chips and queso arrived, chips weren't warm and queso was lukewarm but fine. We were sitting outside so I'll cut them some slack since the taste was acceptable and we were really hungry.

Then the tacos arrive and ruined the night, where do I really even start. The tortillas aren't even tortillas. They are more like cold flat bread. The steak was cold and hard, a recurring theme. The fish (big kahuna) was flavorless and relying heavily on the breading for support. Just all around not good food. My bf and stepson felt the same about their meals.

In conclusion, go somewhere else for the fake taco experience. I hear there's this new trendy spot called Taco Bell. Probably better off checking them out.",-0.486

The lady who was at the start was very mean towards 2 little girls behind us who were ordering, which I though was insane who is rude to little girls?

"I should have listened to the reviews I read on yelp. Instead I was fooled by the pictures of the food. My party had a total of 6 tacos between us and all of them came out ice cold. Not just the toppings, but the meat was also frigid. We could have maybe overlooked the temperature had the tacos actually had any flavor, but all of them were pretty much flavorless overpriced garbage. Speaking of overpriced, when you order the quest dip it doesn't come with chips. Chips have to be purchased separate at an outrageous price of 2.75. This was clear on the menu so I'm not claiming it was deceptive, just a poor value for some low quality melted movie theater nacho cheese and some cold soggy grease soaked ""homemade"" chips. I had high hopes but was extremely disappointed. Additionally, the dining area was very dirty, all
Of the tables and chairs had food and crumbs everywhere. It just seemed like the place was poorly operated. I will never be back and would discourage anyone who asks me about it from going there.

Update & Response to Capital Tacos:

Sure thing buddy, continue your pattern of blaming  and insulting the reviewers for your poor food and dirty dining room. Maybe if you spent less time on yelp insulting your customers and actually listened and accepted some criticism you could work on making your restaurant a better place to dine. Now  since you felt the need to come on here and basically ignore everything I said in my review as well as personally insult me I feel even more strongly about really getting the word out about how bad Capital Tacos actually is. Additionally, I didn't mention it before but I was concerned about food safety with the Luke warm temperatures of everything I was served. I will definitely be following up with some additional visits to get photos and videos of the crap being served by Capital Tacos. Hopefully you step up your game and spend less time on Yelp insulting people who dislike your filthy restaurant, otherwise I will be making many additional posts and reviews everywhere about the dangers of dining at Capital Tacos.

The below is an excerpt from an article on dirty dining published in January of 2019:

For the second time in the past month, Capital Tacos at 6765 Land O' Lakes Blvd., Land O' Lakes, received negative reviews from inspectors. The popular restaurant was cited for 10 violations on Jan. 4 including leaky pipes, an unsealed concrete floor and missing floor tiles on the cook line, a walk-in cooler not cooling at the proper temperature and soil residue on a drying rack.",-0.9941
"Food is underwhelming for the price. $3.75 per taco for grill meats thrown on a tortilla smothered in sauce and with underripe avocado that was inedible. Chips are greasy and $2.75 for small cup full. Queso was $2.75 and small size and served luke-warm. Overall, the food was disappointing would not come back.",-0.6249
"This is probably one of the worst serviced restaurants I have ever been to. Came here and waited over 2 hours for food (4 people). Manager tried to argue and say we didn't wait that long. Total embarassment of a place and of staff. I would not recommend going here",-0.8229
"Impersonal, unfriendly, and constantly trying rush me. They unapologetically skimp on ingredients like no tomorrow, and they will give you a glare if you object. I never have complaints about Chipotle, but this location needs a serious retraining of its staff.",-0.2665
"1 star because 0 wasnt an option. Poor service- sat for 20 minutes before we were given menus. Also, they brought out incorrect drink orders which, by the way, were made very weak.  Daily homemade tortillas is a lie saw them bringing in store bought tortillas. My burrito was all rice, very little of anything else. Portions were small and seemed low quality....had to get pizza afterwards.",-0.4096
"Says the drive thru is open until 3am. Looks open but no one in there. Please change the hours. Not the first time this has happened at this location.  Seems like they have horrible management.",-0.3291
"Not good. Tacos and queso were salty with not much flavor.
Each taco is $3.75 and not really worth it.",-0.5088
"Absolutely ridiculous. Brought my sister here visiting from SC. She is 24 and I am 25. The bouncer did not think her ID was real and refused to give it back even after we decided to call the police to settle it. The manager supported this until we had her passport sent to us to show them that. Will never come back here.",-0.4005
"Who would've thought they could get EVERYTHING  wrong?

I walk in to this guy who's measuring the temperature of the food, (everything was cold) and rather than greeting me, he walks off the the side behind a wall while he waits for this new hire to come take my order. I understand maybe it's not your job to take orders at the moment, but you could at least welcome me and say that someone will help me out shortly. 

The new hire who takes my order clearly isn't trained well enough. She didn't ask if I wanted any beans, she didn't know what sofritas were, waited until we were half way done to ask me if I wanted my order for-here or to-go, and gave me the smallest portion sizes I've ever received at a Chipotle. 

But it doesn't stop there. The girl at the register rings me up without asking if I wanted a drink, gives me to wrong change, and when she rang me up for the drink in a separate transaction, she gave me extra coins and the wrong change again!

Still not done. I'm eager to finally be leaving this wreck so I head out the door with wha I thought was an unsweet tea, only to realize half way down the road the they had put sweet tea in the unsweet tea dispenser.

"This is probably the worst chipotle I've ever been to for a number of reason. First you can count on them being out of at least one thing when you get there. And there have been times when I've made an online order and they don't even put meat in my order. This has happened to me 2 times already and I've only been there a handful of times",-0.5859

"After my last experience I had to return but I was disappointed, the first time I spent about 10 mins watching an employee make fresh their tortilla shells and you could taste the difference in the taco. This time it appears the tacos were store bought and I ordered the same tacos were completely different and not worth the drive. I don't know if this was a ""one-off"" situation whereas the person didn't show up so they went to ""plan B"", but if this is going to be a regular thing I'll find somewhere else to go.",-0.4937

I returned the day after Christmas to ether pick up the order or get a refund . I shift manager had no idea what to do. After looking at my phone for 8 minutes trying to find a Taco bell number for me to call he gave up and said he would be back.  I waited in the lobby for another 20 minutes and he never came back. One of the girls asked why I didn't call before I ordered trying to make me feel stupid.  Now I have to contact my bank dispute the charge. I just wanted my food or my money back.",-0.8442
"Don't waste your time here. This was the worst location I have ever been to. Why you ask?  Because of the following:
Debby/Debbie which ever way she spells it. The assistant manager of this location. But when I called to complain, she said she was the manager. What a classic Sigmund Freud case. This is why...
She was so rude to me. The location screwed up the order and didn't cook our meat good. Raw meat after I said well done. 

After realizing I would get no where with her I stopped trying to make my point. She was soooooo big and tough over the phone, but wouldn't talk to me after I came back. This is so typical of this type of person. I will take the high road, oh yes I could take the low road, and not let this...type of person bother me. Big fish in a little pond. Knows nothing...nothing about customer service 101. 

Yes, the meal was comped. The district sent us $40.00 in gift certificates.  But, that didn't make up for the bad experience. 

Debbie/Debby.... You suck!",-0.9573
"This is a brand new restaurant I ordered from o Cinco de Mayo for a total of $60- definitely not what I was expecting for the cost and the quality is just as bad. This is an example of a $20 dollar chicken and steak fajita, they really outdid themselves on this bland meal and the amount of chicken and steak for the cost is ridiculous. Not to mention they packed the flan with hot food so it was completely melted and ruined.",-0.7693

1. The waitress had multiple blisters on her lips and came out to our table eating. 

2. The food is very bland and you can taste the old grease in the food.  Unable to finish the food. 

3. When we tried to ask for a manager she informed us that there was no manager on duty and seemed unbothered about our complaints.

Of course our food came out before the kids. Then they decided to bring our appetizer last. But wait... it was the wrOng appetizer.

The waitress who directed me outside to the restrooms neglected to mention the broken restroom before she sent me out around the building. Maybe do takeout?

"I honestly don't know how this even has a 2.5 star rating. This, supposed, Mexican food is complete, bland, crap. Service sucked. Maybe it's because authentic Mexican food in CA is on every corner, literally, every corner, in a shack, cash only, but this place sucks. Bad. I'm typically not some sort of California food snob - but if you want real Mexican food then avoid this place like you would a rabid wild animal - cuz you will NOT find authentic food here.",-0.9169
"Geez!! you people need to get your act together every time we come here you guys are disorganized you never have the order ready. Your website doesn't match your system in terms of ordering you're always out of basic food this time it was vegetables and guacamole. What are you actually selling do you even know?  No refund no concession no nothing. You guys are the absolute worst franchisee of the all the Chipotles in freaking Florida I've never seen such an idiotic place. So many other choices I cannot figure out why I would come to this craptastic place. 
We will just head to our other favorite Mexican food place. At least they have their act together because you guys absolutely cannot figure it out I've never seen anything  like it. Unreal. So many idiots running this hot mess. Nobody has time for your nonsense figure it out!!",-0.9651
"first of all - I love chipotle! they fit so much in one burrito lol . 
My fiancé and I went to this store , at the mall before we headed back to sebring; The girl who made my burrito put hardly ANYTHING in it and when I asked for more she literally put the smallest piece of meat .. literally one small piece .. typically I save half of it for later because it is so much food lol , so once we sat down and I tried it the meat was dry and the tortilla was stale.. my fiancé went up to ask for our money back and they said it would go back into our account but it never did.
The staff had a bad attitude about it being ""not fresh"" as well.",-0.3519

"I love Chipotle, but this specific location is disgusting in all aspects. When I went in the staff was extremely stingy and rude with serving portions and did not have an ounce of customer service skills. If I am paying for my meal with you, you better serve me a full spoonful of ingredients, not half! It's absolutely absurd! I'd like to also mention they were wiping around the hot foods with a DIRTY, STAINED rag that had basically turned black from overuse, meanwhile bits of old dirty food were falling off the rag and into the clean foods. I was mortified, how unsanitary is that!? Upon check out some obese, black girl named Jemiah could not have been more unpleasant and rude. Chipotle, are your eyes even open when hiring potential employees?? I repeat, she had zero customer service skills, she was unfriendly, and each time I asked for more food she rolled her eyes and made an annoyed sound. If you don't enjoy working where you are and don't like interacting with paying customers, please get the hell out because you completely destroyed my appetite and my mood due to your rudeness. Besides unpleasant staff, as my girlfriend was eating her burrito bowl she literally pulled a piece of hair out of her mouth. That was it, I had to email headquarters, I'll get back to that. Walking out I noticed the trash can near the door was overfilled and spilling out with trash literally on the floor, lord knows how long it had been sitting there. Clearly, this crew does not really give a crap about cleanliness or customer satisfaction. Good luck getting a response from their website under complaints, because clearly they don't care either. I would definitely give ZERO stars to this crap chain.",-0.9782

"If I could give ZERO stars I would. A party of 5 of us chose to go to Margaritas tonight. It was a bad experience from the minute we walked in. Saturday at 830pm the place was empty. There was one dirty table where it looked like the party up and left their food on the plates. It was 10 minutes before anyone approached us for water or napkins. The drink orders were wrong, we had to wait 20 minutes to get salsa with our chips and the place was empty!! The staff was irritated and rude. The manager scolded us for asking for salt on our glass and served one of our party a very dirty wine glass. We asked to pay our bill so we could get out of there and the manager FOLLOWED us to the parking lot yelling that we were unwelcome. This is AMERICA. We tried to leave to go across the street and eat and the manger continued to approach us in a threatening manner. It was all unnecessary and UN professional. There are too many places to go where we are treated like valued customers. For a local eatery this place has no clue how to treat their patrons. This place is off my list for good.",-0.8715
"This is hands down the worst Chipotle I've ever been to... by far. I've visited 3 times and I actually think they may have gotten worse. After my first visit, I wrote to Chipotle HQ about it, recommending a visit to perhaps provide remedial training to the managers and employees.  I have been a patron at Chipotle restaurants all over the US and I think I have a reasonable sense of expectations: clean areas, efficient employees, fresh and available ingredients. They fail on all three counts. Our portions were tiny. The employees were slow, lazy, and/or annoyed. The checkout counter was filthy. They were out of sour cream (?) and the drink fridge was half empty.  This Chipotle is more Taco Bell than Taqueria. I'll just drive the extra 10-15 mins to a different place.",-0.8689

But, seriously, when a  woman is hungry and expects to get some tofu, don't be surprised when the gates of hell open out of her hungry mouth when she is told (for the third time)) that there is no said tofu.

"Server was not attentive at all.
Did not bring an appetizer that we ordered, just took the order, then the next time we saw her, she was bringing our main course. 

Never checked back after the food arrived to check to see if everything was ok or if we needed more drinks etc.

The steak in the fajitas was TOUGH, some pieces were too tough to chew.

The chicken dish was bland and a bit tough / rubbery as well.

It was very disappointing as it was supposed to be an ""authentic"" Mexican Restaurant - it was far far from that.",-0.5308
"Absolutely Bizarre,
We were seated right away as it was not crowded/full.  Once seated, no one came to our table to bring water, get drink order, greet us, or anything for atleast 10 minutes.  About the time we were about to get up and leave, a waiter came over and brought chip and asked what we wanted to drink.  So we decided to go ahead and put our food order in as we were already frustrated from waiting.
There were no napkins or silverware so I had to go grab them for our table on our own.
The food.  One person at our table asked if something they didnt like was in the item they ordered and the waiter ensured it wasnt.  Once the food came, it was full of them.  So the waiter clearly had no idea about the food.  The burrito i ordered was no good. 70% of was luke warm yellow rice that felt like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for hours.  The chicken tasted like frozen chicken out of a box.  There was no beans and really no flavor.
Finally the waiting game again.  No one ever came over to ask about refills for our drinks the whole time there.  We had to finally ask for our check as no one came to bring one or even ask.
After they cleaned the table and we were waiting around for the check.  The Manager who had been walking around the whole time we were there, came and introduced himself and droped off silverware as if we just sat down (would've been nice if he did that an hour and a half earlier instead of me wondering around the restaurant looking for napkins/silverware).",-0.9225

Update to respond to company's comment: I did contact the store and spoke to the manager. She apologized and told me to contact UberEats for a refund and to come into the store the next day for a remade burrito. I did not go back for a remake because I don't trust your restaurant at all anymore.

Needless to say, I was far from impressed. The young lady working the head of the line had a terrible attitude and wasn't helpful at all.  She seemed super annoyed with me and I said so out loud, to the surprise of another employee that overheard me.  
The food was just okay but they skimped on everything; meat, cheese, sour cream, guacamole... everything. For what I paid, I should be able to have as much sour cream as I want. I rarely feel like I wasted money on food,  but this was $60 down the drain for our family of 7 to eat.

All in all, I doubt we'll be back to this Moes or any if this is how their food and service is. Guess I'm spoiled by the service that Tijuana Flats gives,  which is right across the road.",-0.0101

I arrived at 1:30 and saw the pick up order shelf to be empty and approximately 8 people standing around waiting for pick up orders. I have the girl at the cashier my name and order pick up time and I was met with an attitude far from that of good customer service. About 10 minutes later I reminded her of my order and she finally printed out the order receipt and gave it to the two guys making orders. I finally received my order at 1:50pm and did not receive any apology or kind gesture regarding the wait and horrible customer service. I got home and opened up my order, BOTH orders were WRONG. I was missing items on both orders and both orders had items on them we did not order. To add this fiasco, my food was not even room temperature warm, no napkins and not eating utensils. I WILL NOT return to this location. This location gives chipotle a bad look and I strongly hope chipotle comes in and does an overhaul. Lost my business permanently.",-0.9367
"This chipotle is consistently terrible. I went in at 8:15pm on a Tuesday to a long line that was barely moving. I stood in line for 15 minutes and watched the people working start orders then leaving to go in the back. They all opened refrigerators and went in the back with the gloves on they wore to grab food without changing them when they got back. The line was messy with food all over the surfaces. They were out of black beans and steak, both of which I generally order, and said they wouldn't be making more even though they had over an hour before closing and a line of people. The lettuce for the salad was almost empty and what was left did not look fresh. The staff was slow, and seemed uninterested in anyone they were serving, and there wasn't a manager of any sort in sight. Needless to say I didn't stick around to eat, and after many disappointments I doubt I will again. 

Do yourself a favor and go across the street to Qdoba where the staff is always friendly and fast and the food's always fresh.",-0.8239
"This was the most mismanaged dining time ive had in tampa since i stopped eating fast food. McDonalds is more organized then this place. I called a day in advance to reserve seating for 15 people. I showed up on time at 630 and the table wasnt even reserved. It took another 30 minutes to get that done. No silverware. No water. It took 1 hour an 45 minutes to get our ordered delivered! Everyone ordered tacos. Something a street taco vendor can handle instantly. Yet this place cant get it done with 2 cooks and a full kitchen. I will never dine here again. Food was subpar and i still got charged full price. Never again",-0.75
"The worst service I have experienced at a Moe's franchise. The workers are rude and incompetent. After multiple errors with deliveries (three of my deliveries - taco packs - contained only sides and no protein), I decided to take my daughter to order in person because she loves the chicken. The workers were incredibly rude. At first they wouldn't take her order and implied she could not pay for it. They skipped over her to the next customer even after she said she knew the cost of a taco pack.  When I went in to see what the problem was, they continued to ignore us. There where three people behind the line and two of them just stood there doing nothing while the line got longer. After 15 minutes of waiting (for them to finish the orders of the customers who had been behind my daughter), I ordered the taco pack. I got home and discovered they had left out the sides. I am never returning, and I'll be happy to see it fail so a reliable business can take its place.",-0.9502

My husband and I live on the island, besides the usually subpar restaurants on DI this restaurant takes the cake for their horrific tasting non-fresh food/ingredients to the IDGAF attitudes from a majority of the servers, especially from several of the main female ones. 

We, as well were giving wrong orders on numerous accounts, not only do they talk bad about you in Spanish in which we both are fluent in, they take no blame or offer any kind of reimbursement, even apologetic. The first couple times we wouldn't have except it but time after time and the righteous I don't care attitude and now wasting my time and no my time in your error for the food I specifically asked for many times before pick up so there was no issues, still wrong! It's sad because over a year ago we went 2-3 times a week to eat or have an after dinner drink, those days are over and now we happily take an Uber to Miguelitos where we are served properly and if there's an issue it's taking care of before I can finish my sentence.

We waited for the chicken and brown rice (about 5 mins) but were told  steak would take forever so didnt wait for that.  Thus, my son got a burrito he didnt want.    Anyways, the ""general manager"" sensed my frustration and was gracious enough to offer me a BOGO card.  So..... if i come back and spend more money (after my $40 family lunch) they will give me one free.  no thanks. I will be driving to  the westshore location.   One last thing.  the gentleman cutting the chicken gave us all a dirty look when we asked for steak.  It was cooked but he was cutting chicken and would not stop to offer us steak.

"If it was possible to give less stars, I definitely would!!  We simply ordered chips and queso and two burritos.  Everything was horrible.

To start, when our order was called, I walked up immediately.  Our food was just left on the counter for anyone to take it and for anything to happen to it.  Being the person I am, I asked if the food was ours.  I received an attitude and heard,  ""If you're Connecticut.""  (They assign you state names instead of asking your name.  A simple way to be even less customer service oriented.)
Next, the chips were as hard as rocks.  The queso was room temperature.  It was not even warm!  I went and asked for our queso to be warmed.  It was simply replaced by another side of the exact same temperature queso.
Also, our burritos both had iced salsa.  How do you try to serve meat with salsa that's as cold as you just took it out of the freezer?!  Have you never heard of warmers??

My advice is to avoid this place at all costs.  There are other restaurants within the same area.  Chipotle is just down the street.  The Mill is basically next door.  And Latin Grill is right across the street.",-0.7712

So then I continue with my order and the person making it seemed annoyed. Then to top it off the burrito breaks in small pieces when she wraps it .. she asked if I wanted rewrapped or dumped... what??? She the dumped it into another one and half of the inside is still I. The broken flour shell. So now I have a baby burrito. Sad. I  never come back ... stay with what you know New Tampa here I come. This place unprofessional and just sad.",-0.9574

"Well this location is definitely different from my usual location. The staff is not very friendly. I eat at chipotle at least once a week and have never seen such a small serving of chicken. I had to ask for the proper serving size ( the staff member proceeded to rudely question if I was sure) I don't mind paying the price for quality food but not being given a ridiculous small serving. The cashier had no clue what we had order and staff member in line before her rudely yelled it out to her. There seems to be very poor communication between them. I'll definitely stick to my Westchase location. The Citrus Park one is not the one to go to.",-0.7962
"I will never order from this chipotle ever again. I ordered off Uber Eats, and they were so late to get the order ready.. took an hour to get the food. I paid extra for chicken and got what felt like a half of a scoop. So frustrated! That service there is horrible. They are lucky that they are getting 1 Star, because they are so bad.

Our waitress was not friendly, and obviously was not able to handle the four tables she had, even though they were within 3 feet of one another. My friend received the wrong meal, and then it took 10 minutes for them to bring another one, while me and another friend had our food getting cold in front of us. They also take forever to bring you any NAPKINS or SILVERWARE, basically forcing you to stare at your food and build up an appetite just to be LET DOWN by the lack of flavor. We asked for condiments, and our waitress completely forgot, so we decided to go inside and ask for ourselves, but the worker inside had no clue what was going on either and looked at me as if I had three eyes. Just then our waitress walked in and heard me asking about the sauce and shook it off as ""YEAH I know, the sauce,"" while rolling her eyes.

None of the other workers seemed concerned at all. Don't think anyone even manages this place- just seems like a bunch of new servers who have no clue how to handle tables or make decent food. Wouldn't be surprised if it closes down soon.

But they have cheap beer! -shaking my head- My partner had a fajita burrito which he said he liked. OTOH I found nothing redeeming about my chicken poblano. It was basically little pieces of dry rubbery chicken that were tossed in a brownish sauce that didn't taste anything like mole. The accompanying refried beans & rice were lukewarm & tasteless. No slices of avocado that were supposed to be on the plate.

I really can't see any reason to go back.",-0.3832

"Terrible Taco Bell! Late taco night after moving in to new home. Son was excited about getting an Xbox offer on a Pepsi cup there at Taco Bell. Went to the drive-through, they said their credit card machine was not working and they would not take any bills larger than 20. I'm a petite mom with a kid, and They sent me across the street to the liquor store to get change. Of course I did not go to the liquor store and drove a distance to get some change, came back and they forgot my drink.  Waited for the drink, and  got home with the Pepsi cup. The code for the Xbox contest offer had already been used. Extremely disappointing and mad that they would do that to  kids.. not to mention, they were working with no gloves on, and only put the gloves on to take money from the window.

I know that they have diablo sauce I just don't like saying it because I'm Spanish and I know that means devil lol but still what kind of stuff is that? How are you just going to give me regular old hot sauce? At least the Cinnabon's were tasty!",-0.769

"I totally understand that mistake happen. I would never consider leaving a bad review on my 1st visit, but visit was BAD. We ordered the Birria tacos and they were burnt to shit. Bad enough I had to ask for them to remake it. I had asked for no onion and the burned ones were right and the 2nd ones had onions. I let them know I didn't want onions and they told me to pick them off, which I am sure anyone who doesn't like onions knows when they are pressed into the taco there is no picking it out, the flavor is in the meat. We also had a steak quesadilla which comes with a side of guac and pico. Since again I am a picky eater I asked for sour cream (wayyyyy cheaper to buy) instead of the guac (Not in addition to) and the charged me .50 for the sour cream. Which isn't really a big deal to me, but it more of the point of the matter. My husband is Mexican, so of course he tried the lengua, he liked it but wasn't crazy for it. Non the less if I hadn't gotten the onion attitude I may have come back, but this is an official no go for me. I can overlook okay food for good service but not the other way around",-0.9377
"I hate to give this a 1 star, but honestly I cannot say one thing I enjoyed about this meal.

I hate giving this such a bad review but this restaurants food quality was extremely poor. 

To add, it took 34 minutes to order our dinner and so far it's been over 20 minutes since asking for our check. We can leave right?? Lol",-0.309
"Ah where should I began. First off, I'm at GL very often for their crowd favorite Taco Tuesday but the last time I went was easily my worst time there. We sat outside underneath the tenth where they have more tables for social distancing but I've never sat outside during all of the times I've gone here during covid and prior to. Underneath the tent they have a lovely dj who plays all of the best music. I'm not sure why they have this DJ outside because you can't even stand up at your own table and do a nice little sway or dance. Our waitress Milan was the sweetest person ever and kept checking on us and was very attentive in spite of her being new. it was her rude counter part Natalia that took us over the edge. Natalia rudely yelled at us ONE time to sit down and not dance because they could get in trouble with the city if they drove by. We also saw her go over to another table of minorities and address them but she never went to the table full of white girls which rubbed me the wrong way because I myself am an African American male and my friends that I was with that evening are also that of African American decent so it comes off a bit racist. After we asked Natalia for her manager (I think it was Ryan)  because her approach and delivery was terrible, he then takes her side and says ""Natalia is great. I never get any complaints about her. Weren't you guys apart of the group that called her the b word last week??"" I was so offended and appalled because he probably thought of some random table of black people to compare us to and that's not even in our character to act like that. We also asked him what's the point of having a DJ if you don't want people to dance and he couldn't come up with one reason to justify it because any human person is going to dance to good music. Ryan was one of the worst managers I've dealt with in food service and he said he would talk to Natalia at the end of the night even though we insisted he speak with her now so that she doesn't address another table the way she did ours. I was so disappointed and upset that I hope that I never have to deal with this manager again the next time I go if I do return. Natalia and Ryan do not deserve to be at such an amazing establishment like Green Lemon with their terrible customer service and bad attitudes.",-0.9622
"Literally the worst service I have ever received in my life. The white  ""shift manager"" was incredibly rude and racist towards my wife (who is Latina).

"Poor Customer Service.  The hostess is suppose to be the welcoming center of your business and if your customers do not feel welcomed then why should we eat there or support your business!

Let me start with the fact that I did not eat there and I can not fairly comment on any of their food items. If you have been here before then you know it is a relatively smaller venue. We arrived this past Friday ( a party of 3...all professionals, not that it should matter) to try out O Cocina for the first time.  Excited because we heard good things about this place. Upon entering at 6:20 on Friday one of the 2 ladies at the hostess stand asked if we ""had reservations""   We did not. But I gazed around and assessed the small volume of patrons and thought we should be okay.  The older lady at the hostess stand literally looked at the seating chart for 3 minutes wondering where she was going to squeeze us in.  It was almost comical the length of time she was anguishing over it.  Again, I looked around ... 5 patrons at the bar, 5 of the 6 center booths empty and a table in the back with a party of about 8.  The other 85-90% of the place was empty with service/staff standing. I asked if we could have one of the 5 empty booths and again the older hostess rudely responded ""no, there all reserved"" and her eyes diverted back to the seating chart for another full minute or so.  I look at my friends and said I am sure we would eat, pay our check and there will still be empty booths here. 
The older hostess ignoring my comment finally made a decision to allow us a table in the back.  No welcome to O Cocina, no smile, rude attitude, as if we interrupted her ""busy"" schedule.  She sent us to our table with the younger hostess and upon seating I asked if it was just me or was that how we were ""welcomed"". 

Consensus agreed.  We decided that we could spend our paycheck in another place where we felt welcomed as a customer. 
Upon leaving I let the older hostess know we were leaving because of her rudeness and she was more than welcome to keep her empty tables.  

I certainly hope management does some training on customer service and making the customer feel welcomed in a community where we literally have hundreds  of other options to patronize.",-0.56
"If I could give this location zero stars I would. This chipotle is very poorly managed. I visited the site at 12:30 during lunch hour. They had no cheese and no black beans. I asked if they could exchange the lack of cheese with queso which they reply with yes and then charged me for it. One girl was learning how to roll burritos while the line was piling out the door and another girl was learning how to use the cash register.
I will not be visiting the site again.",-0.5859

"Finally made it to Green Lemon yesterday evening. Sorry to say the first visit will be the last. Food was mediocre at best and atmosphere is excessively noisy so forget about visiting with friends. We started out with a few trio appetizers, elotes and drinks. We were a party of 8, a few ordered tortilla soup, some had tostadas, some had bowls. I had the tuna bowl & it was awful. Needless to say, we spend over $200 and it sucked!  Actually, it's an overpriced Chipotle. Entire party agreed, cross Green Lemon off the list and never go back. Truly disappointed.",-0.1253

"My mother and I ate at Moe's today after a long morning of moving.  It couldn't have been later than 2pm when we entered the store. There was a young lady with blonde shoulder length hair working the cash register who eventually helped me and ruined my day.  My mom was served by a young man with brown short brown hair with glasses.  The young man didn't say ""Welcome To Moe's!"" when we walked in so my mom jokingly, brought it to his attention.  He looked at her and forced a fake smile and said "" I'm sorry would you like me to say it now""?  It at first was received by both of us as if he was having a bad day.  Huffing and puffing while taking her order and building her burrito, the young lady be-grudgingly approached me to take mine and she too acted as if we had offended her personally. She refused to put a little extra meat on my order and charged me $1.99 while my moms burrito was packed with meat for free.
at the end of the ordeal, I was hit and foot ran over by a third employee while they emptied the trash.  I hope this is not standard procedure if so I would believe theres an opportunity for a law suit.  If there was a time for ""Undercover Boss"" this store would be a great one to visit. Look at all the other bad reviews.  My mom says this is not the first time.  These kids need supervision or this franchise will be in a world of problems. Nasty is how we were treated. i didn't bore you with more details as Im tired of thinking about it.

Then when you call to talk to a manager, they don't answer the phone!  Chipotle, if you can't handle the order, and you're understaffed like half of America, shut down!  Quality over quantity should be the priority...after all, if I recall, this was your opening motto!  Unreal!",-0.732

I understand a mistake here and there, but EVERY SINGLE TIME I've ordered delivery, it's been made wrong. Clearly the workers here are not being managed well enough, if even at all.

I went to the front door and knocked several times, they kept staring but did not respond. Went to drive thru again, and was treated very rudely.

Issue 1: bearded employee did not have a hair net for his large beard while preparing my food.
Issue 2: same worker pulled his phone out from his pocket to turn off a call or something, then proceeded to continue handling my food without changing gloves. Gross.
Issue 3: As I left the line, several employees were laughing because one of them kept getting caught ""eating on the line."" I don't know if that meant eating her own food out in the assembly area or eating food from the assembly area, but either way, it doesn't sound great.

I informed the management here about these issues, but the staff response was rather nonchalant, even the manager's. This location is a little out of my way anyhow so I don't think I'll be returning to this particular location.",-0.0552

And we stood by Chipotle throughout the whole salmonella thing a couple years ago.  This was a disgusting location.  Starting with parking lot with much Chipotle garbage, cups, bags, lids laying around.  As you approach the front doors you pass by the over flowing trash cans.  I asked the first server for a beef bowl and he prepared a pork bowl.  I said ""beef"", and he just looked at me.  I'm guessing a Spanish language barrier.  When I told the next server that I had asked for beef he said ""it's his job"", pointing to first guy.  Between the two I finally got my beef bowl.  When checking out I was charged for two bowls.  I didn't catch it until after inserting my card for payment.  So the refund process caused a delay.  As I waited I had the unfortunate opportunity to look at the condition of the line.  There was used plastic gloves, food, utensils scattered about the servers feet on the floor in view of us.  Getting my drinks at the drink station was disappointing.  The iced tea I chose looked like water, and the station was a mess.  Taking our food outside to the tables to get out of the place.  The outdoor dining area was as bad as the inside.  I couldn't make it through my meal and left promptly.
   The signs on the location stating ""Help Wanted"".  I hope it is management help they find.

Absolutely love Chipotle but how can 1 location always be extremely slow, always out of food and slow to restock on the pass, and always have stale kids chips!? It's because of the employees you've got running your shifts. The last time I was here OMG...the fajita veggies weren't cooked enough, the salsa was watery, the kids chips were stale, then the girl at the register places my orders on the tray and spills my salsa all over the tray.

Also a guy waiter kicked my chair and completely moved it and didn't turn around to apologize instead he laughed.... I'm never going back to this place.
Oh and the frozen margarita machine broke.",-0.8877
"Waited over half an hour for a table of 7 and the hostess had a hostile and authoritarian attitude the entire time. When we were finally called to be seated, they told us they needed to split us up and that we could not put the tables together due to some bs excuse about people being able to walk. At this point, we were fed up with her rudeness and coldness forwards us and decided to spend our money elsewhere. The manager then told us we could combine the tables, but the dining experience was already beyond saving. 

I don't know the name of the hostess who was managing tables last night at 7PM, but if the owner or management reads this, please re-train your employees on how to interact with customers because your hostess has embarrassed your restaurant and is a huge risk for Green Lemon's reputation.",-0.2293
"I will not go back to the Brandon chipotle grill. Their employee had the absolute worst attitude I have ever experience. My daughter stood at the cash register, unanswered for a few minutes while her and Her co-worker continued to prep food in the back. Wasn't thrilled about this but ok, they have to work. But, then she walks up to the register and tells my total. No hello? No awknowledgement of any kind? Really? She tells me total, and then I give her the money. I actually give her extra, and told her to keep it as I went to walk away. She then turns to start complaining about me to her coworkers as she tosses my receipt in the trash. 
As I go back to ask her her name, she snaps me, ""it's on the receipt."" You read that correct. The receipt that was just thrown in the trash. By her. No attempt to get it for me. Cool.  Pretty aggravated by now. I ask her for the receipt at this point. Now, she thinks it's appropriate to tell start getting upset with me!! I'm so beyond belief at this point. So chipotle at Brandon has lost my business. Stephanie does not need to be behind the register or anywhere dealing with customers or customer service. I'll be happy to take my business else wear.",-0.5388

"Update: Regarding the reply from the company: I don't doubt that y'all make everything from scratch with the ""finest quality ingredients"" and I didn't say that I doubted any of that in the review. If you received the taco I posted a photo of and it was called the ""Big Kahuna"" would you be impressed? I took that photo as soon as I opened the box. The fish was cold and over cooked. You can have the finest ingredients and 800 step recipes but if your cook fucks the fish up he fucks it up. I'm not going to be coming back but thanks for informing me that even with the finest quality ingredients in the world your tacos still turned out like shit.",-0.6234

Upon speaking to The ""manager"" Lloyd, he said, ""things happen, we dropped the ball but that's no reason for you to get upset."" And told me to go on chipotle.com to get a refund. So I did and chipotle didn't even send me a confirmation email stating they are going to resolve my issue. Fuck chipotle. I've always been a Qdoba fan anyway.

Tonight i had an extremely rude emplloyee ask me if i was deaf, because she told me once before there was no tomatos without cilantro. She was extremely rude. Does Chipotle thinks everyone likes cilantro??? How about tomatoes without it!!!!! That would be to smart an idea for them, i used to eat there 3-4 times a week!!! Never again!!!

After telling bartender y'all has lousy service. I been heard a while and was never offered anything. So I cancel my order after confronting manage since it been a while anyway. the manager cussed me after I confronted him about the service.

I had to wait longer and one of the times I was so mad I just left and when I hot home I noticed they didn't give me my chips and queso (which by the way are overpriced). I am just going to start driving a couple extra miles to Moe's , at least those guys get my orders right every time.

Then unless you watch the person making it, there are mistakes in the order itself. Terrible place",-0.7351

Not sure why I keep going back expecting different results.",-0.6442
"This has been the worst service I've ever received in any establishment. The waitress only had four tables, and took wayyy too long between drinks, etc. Even being condescending when asked for waters we had previously requested. Then when finally addressed requesting to speak with management regarding poor service, she once again condescendingly addressed me to advice she was the manager. I happen to have recognized the owner, and asked if he was able to come speak with me. She went back to get him, and returned with him about ten minutes later. 
In the meantime someone tried to deliver the Mofongo I requested taken off the bill due to everyone else being almost done with food and I sent it back. The owner approached the table carrying the Mofongo to a very stern way to advice he was put up to date with our table's situation and for such reasons decided to remove the Mofongo from the bill. He set the Mofongo down by the salad I was eating (without the oil I never received). I finished the bite of salad I was chewing on and informed him it would only make sense he take off the item since I wasn't eating it. He responded, ""You're not understanding, I'm not charging you for the Mofongo and you're welcome to eat it"". I reiterated I had no intention on eating such plate. He then asked why was I so discontent with my experience. I told him in all the years being a patron I'd never received such poor service there or for that matter anywhere. He proceeded to inform me the chips were no longer given free due to new COVID19 health department regulations. I responded in understanding the chips were not complimentary anymore, but that had little to nothing to deal with the poor service we received. I pointed out there were three or four other servers who each had only one table while the ""manager"" was poorly tending to four or five tables. The manager then attempted to interject, at which was immediately and extremely unprofessionally hushed by the owner. He proceeded to point how the virus had affected their way of doing business due to items needing to be done fresh. When I attempted to rebuttal such new regulations had nothing to do with the level of service, he hushed me and asked I allowed him to finish. He went on to say he didn't know what else to do to make up for it. I gestured at my parents food, but he ignored. He asked if there was anything else he could do, and I responded he had done enough. It was my first time speaking since he hushed me. 
He then left the table without even a fair well. My parents come from Ocala to visit, and this place was one of their favorites. They were so disgusted by the owner's response, they asked never again to be taken there to eat. My father spent the greater part of our lives as an entrepreneur, and said he doesn't understand how someone with such poor people skills remained in business. I responded it obviously was all due to his staff, but if that was his new manager (never seen her there before) he won't be in business much longer. It's a real shame such poor customer service etiquette be the demise of such a well established business. My father insisted on paying the tab, and I asked to leave the gratuity. As I recognized the problem came from the top, and did not want the rest of the servers negatively affected if they shared tips. Last time we will ever set foot in this establishment",-0.9843

"If I could rate lower I would.  Today I visited the Chipotle location on Gandy Blvd. in Tampa Florida.  I have visited this location several times since it has opened and always left in disappointment.  Today will be the last time I ever visit.  When I visited today, I stood waiting for an employee to help me, yet there was no one in the restaurant.  The man finally came over and asked what I wanted.  I explained I wanted a chicken bowl.  I had to ask for more rice since in the past the portions barely filled a quarter of the bowl.  I asked for black beans which appeared to have been sitting out all day.  I requested fajitas (peppers and onions) however the container was left with small and shriveled remnants.  I asked if there were any fresh ones being prepared and he said yes, stating it will only take a minute. I proceeded to confirm that I wanted chicken. He literally only scooped out enough chicken to only fill the tip of the spoon. This equated to approximately 7 tiny, dry, pieces of chicken in my bowl. He then proceeded to finish the rest of the bowl with the ingredients I desired, however the bowl was left open waiting for the peppers and onions to finish.  I waited for approximately 5 minutes after realizing my bowl was getting cold.  I just asked to box it up without the peppers and onions since it was probably getting cold. I asked for a side of the green salsa which he filled approximately a third of the way full in the cup. I then leave and return home. Sure enough by the time I got home (half a mile away) it was in fact ice cold.  As I sit here and type this, I feel sick to my stomach since I believe the ingredients were old and not fresh.  Based on the bad reputation Chipotle has recently received in the media by directly causing patrons to get e coli, one would think that the Chipotle experience would be rated highly in order to restore their reputation.  However, I am here now questioning if I will ever return to another Chipotle.  It is unfortunate since I have been frequenting Chipotles for over 10 years.",-0.3818

For one the sanitation was disgusting and they had food everywhere on the floors, counters and tables, their main server was completely disrespectful had AirPods in his ears, when I asked about a certain item he said I said it out loud there's 50 people behind you waiting to get food... absolutely disrespectful and not customer friendly at all. He most certainly didn't say anything regarding the item i asked about so In return I told him I didn't hear any thing out of your mouth about that particular item. I then asked for the General manager and they did nothing to reprimand their disrespectful employee. Horrible food horrible service DO NOT GO",-0.9399

"If I could give zero stars I would.. Earlier this evening I ordered a chicken bowl inside the restaurant (citrus park Tampa FL)and half way through the bowl I noticed a piece of my lettuce was moving. There was a bug under the piece of lettuce! ALIVE! The bug was trying to flip itself over and the legs moving under the lettuce is what caused me to notice it. That is absolutely disgusting and unacceptable. This is very traumatizing for me because I was two seconds from picking that up with my fork and eating it. It is very likely that there could have been more and who is to say I didn't eat one! This company advertises how it's  ingredients are always fresh but I can no longer believe that after my experienced tonight. I returned to the restaurant with the bug in the bowl and showed the manager and he was completely disgusted and gave me a refund however, I nor my family or friends will be returning to chipotle",-0.8188

Go to Qdoba down the street or even Taco Bell, this place is awful",-0.5719
"I have never had a Chipotle meal that I didn't like until the day I walked into this location. 
Under seasoned everything .. meat, beans, toppings. Bland!
Pico de gallo was extremely watery so when placed in my burrito bowl there was pool action going on. 
You guys, please let the pico de gallo drain a little through the spoon before you plop it onto someone's meal. Common sense. 
It was also the most flavorless pico de gallo I've ever had. Not enough salt , lime or cilantro . Just a watery waste of tomatoes. 
Guacamole made with overripe avocados. Brown and mushiness happening *sigh* 
The bowl was disgustingly made.
Too much everything. Complete overkill. 
10lbs. of rice, 2lbs. ofbeans, 2lbs. of corn, 2lbs. of pico de gallo etc etc .. .. lettuce poking out of closed container...  You get the point. 
I'm not one of those customers who likes this. I don't feel like you're hooking me up with more food. 
I like appropriate portions. Overkill on everything ruins the taste. 
I took 4 bites of the bowl and threw it in the garbage. I was grossed out. It was not only visually unappealing , but tasted like total shit. 
I would have definitely returned it if I had dined in, but unfortunately it was online pick-up order. 
No way I'm coming back to this location again or else they will turn me off to Chipotle for life .

The beans are splattered everywhere! Their cheese (queso) and sour cream is touching their not fresh shredded lettuce, fajitas, and on their chicken!!! I have a severe dairy allergy.

One of the workers sprinkled 4 strands of cheese on a burrito and scooped a half ladle of queso into a large queso cup (it takes 5 scoops to fill the cup usually, for reference) Instead of taking away the old rice or other food the worker just kept putting new food on top of it so you just end up eating older/not fresh food. Multiple people ended up leaving the line and in the end we ended up leaving too. Chipotle- get it together! Pay your workers more so they actually will put an effort in their job. This is the worst Chipotle.",-0.6996
"We tried eating here again because I figured hey, worse case scenario I liked their salsa in the past so at least that'll be good. 
Horrible. Worst experience with Mexican since Tijuana Flats. The salsa? Take a hard pass as it's literally tomato juice with three pieces of cilantro floating in it. Surely if there's cilantro that means flavor, right? You'd be wrong, the most bland tomato water possible, I don't feel right calling it salsa. The chips were pretty bland, a little stale tasting, and not salted, but didn't save the poor quality tomato water. 
Let's talk tacos now. The Carne Asada is not great, lots of chewy and the tortillas while they seem homemade, weren't great either. Dry, crumbly, and didn't appear to be a corn tortilla as ordered due to dietary restrictions in my party. The Carnitas was the only redeeming item in our order, but the item we got the least of to our dismay. Flavorful and juicy, the pork met expectations well and even helped cover the funkiness of the tortilla. 
As far as hot sauces go, we received a bright red sauce and a Chile verde. The red sauce packed quite a punch and was carrying a good heat but lacked actual flavor. The verde carried no heat but had a little flavor that complimented the carnitas well. 

Overall- will not eat from here again. Figured a place with ""Authentic Mexican Cuisine"" in the title would serve just that but was disappointed time and again.",-0.5185
"I love chipotle, but this place is horrible firstly I ordered online and waited almost 1 hour from the time I was suppose to get the food. Service is absolutely horrible employees had attitude, not only that every single thing that I ordered was wrong literally everything. I said no beans they put beans. I think the chefs were blind or deaf putting on random ingredients left and right they are putting food that weren't even part of the order. Definitely a disappointment to the chipotle franchise and corporate needs to handle things right. I tried calling the store multiple times and they never answered on top of that before I even said anything on the customer service they already refunded me shows that they did this on purpose If they had a 0 star review rating that's what it would be.",-0.969

I was personally not drinking so I didn't have this issue but it is really upsetting to particularly go to a Mexican based restaurant and have them tell you they can not take your non-US Id's, I consider this disrespectful even. That is not all though, the first waitress we got was extremely rude and sarcastic. We went to eat there for a birthday and we asked her if they could sing happy birthday and she said and I quote ""we don't embarrass people like that here"". That is not the way you talk to a costumer and even less if it is a party of 10+.  She was rude just to one but multiple people in the table. We were completely thrown off by her attitude We specifically chose this place because we have been here before and have had a wonderful time we thought that we would get a good service and we even spoke with the manager and asked to get a new server, she was understanding and we got a new server a very nice young man. This might be the very last time we come here. Very disappointed and I wouldn't recommend to anyone.

Instead of working with her, he just said ""oh well"" and when she asked to speak with a manager, HE WAS THE MANAGER. While waiting, I saw FOUR people go to order the steak, and after a condescending sassy response from him, THEY ALL LEFT TO GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. After OVER 10 minutes of waiting for the steak, I asked if it was ready and his response? ""It will be ready when its ready, if you don't want to wait, you can go somewhere else."" YES, THAT IS CORRECT! THAT WAS A MANAGERS RESPONSE TO ME!!! Another girl (who was also waiting for the steak) quickly came to my side and said we have all been waiting here over 10 minutes, which is how long you said it would take, it is lunch rush hour and this is completely ridiculous. Now, a decent manager would just say ""you're right, it is taking a little longer than expected, here is some free queso while you wait"". Instead, this boy goes to yell at us!!! As you can see in the attached picture where he starts raising his hands and getting loud and defensive with us! We both ended up leaving after that altercation because to be spoken so rudely to by a manager is COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE. I had to drive 10 minutes away to another Chipotle, wait in another 15 minute line, and when I got to the front I asked to speak with their manager on how to report him (from the other store) to headquarters. She politely explained that they are over-worked, under-staffed, (and I also know that they are under-paid). She apologized for his behavior and gave me my meals for free. She was a saving grace in what is becoming a terrible institution. 

PLEASE FIRE THIS MANAGER! In the 20 minutes I was there he lost SO MANY CUSTOMERS completely based on his rude, condescending, arrogant behavior. HE DOES NOT DESERVE TO BE A MANAGER. THERE IS NO TRAINING OR DEMOTION THAT WILL EVER SOLVE SOMEONE WITH HIS TYPE OF PERSONALITY.",-0.8252
"I have never been so disappointed by a Chipotle. I ordered a burrito bowl and chips and guac for delivery. When my food came, it was messy, my bowl had like three pieces of lettuce on it, and my guac wasn't there. Well, I called the Chipotle to see if I could just get my money back for the guac. Not only did she tell me it was the Uber Eats delivery driver's fault for not checking and making sure the order was right, but she refused to accept responsibility for their part in the mixup and acted like I was an idiot when she was telling me that DoorDash and Uber Eats are the same thing (they're not).  She also told me the only way I could get my money back was if I came into the store (in the middle of a pandemic). Forgetting the guac wasn't a huge deal and I could look past the rest of the issues with my order, but the customer service is just terrible and I won't be back to this location. It's a bummer, too...I love Chipotle.",-0.7843
"NEVER and I mean NEVER order online I have twice and it's literally the most disrespectful thing ever! They just assume since you're takeout that you won't check before you leave so they always do a shitty job! I've gone back in for them to redo my order and when I walk in they just look at me and ask ""oh we're you an online order? "" so they already know they did a shitty job before I had to say anything  truly and utterly disrespectful. They give no regards to the money people are paying. If you want good service I suggest you go in person and watch them prepare your food. If you want online because you're in a hurry I suggest you try a different location",-0.5837
"I don't even like leaving bad reviews, and I love chipotle food (I go to different ones frequently) but I Gotta be honest, they're gonna quite literally take any online or group order before anybody actually waiting in line. If there's more than 15 people in line, you will for sure be waiting 30-35 minutes because the entire line is healed up to do Uber and online orders. Even though there's an online order section, it truly seems that they don't even use it. Last few times I've been there's nobody running that section and for some reason the people waiting in line have to wait. I've sat at the front of the line for 10-15 minutes while they immediately processed the new online orders. 2 different times that I've been here they've told the entire line that they have to leave because their ""system went down"" and once the line had to leave due to the credit card system going down. 

Again, I hate leaving bad reviews and every other chipotle I've been too is ok... but this one is horrendous. And my last bad experience was mid day after lunch time.. showed up with just 6 people in front of me and when I left 30 minutes later the line was 25 people long because they're sitting their doing online orders in the order-in section. I'm gonna guess there's a lot more bad reviews for this location.

I love chipotle, luckily there's another one of these 1 mile away in the Branson mall. I'd rather park at Branson mall and walk into the mall to order there than go to this one.",-0.341

Beans were mushy, rice was crunchy, and practically everything else needed salsa and hot sauce to create flavor. Oh. And the sprint to the toilet in 10 mins after finishing the meal.  Not good.
Nothing adds up about this location. It's in a great spot with lots of traffic, yet they employ people who play on their phones and lack any energy to do their job.  They seemed annoyed that I was there to order a meal. I really tried to give this another try but yet again they failed. And again, their AC still doesn't work.",-0.6258

Whoever runs this location isn't doing a good job.",-0.8421

If you hate your job so badly just quit and spare the paying customers the aggravation. On this visit It seemed like the employee was really bothered to see a paying customer, not a word was said other than what can I get you? I got 2 bowls with white rice, that wasn't cooked probably,one with chicken and the other the ""New"" Brisket which tasted like reheated crap. The portions in both bowls were minuscule at best and the nerve to upcharge 10.00 for the brisket, what a ripoff. The ice machine was broken as well, so you had to settle for a luke warm drink, great way to end the visit. Management needs to have an intervention with this staff as they fail miserably in all aspects of customer experience and customer service. There was not even a thank you or a look up from the cashier, way to go, who's training these employees??",-0.7983

The food, blah blah blah, and blah.  Is it frozen and heated up?  I don't know. Seemed like it. I don't pay for frozen and reheated. I can make that even better.

We had the paisa dish. I forget the name. It's steak, sausage, arepa, avocado rice and beans. It's big that's why we split it, but there was no flavor, seasoning, anything.

If you order fajitas and tell them NO PEPPERS, its because I don't like the taste of peppers.

Idiots... and goodbye.",-0.7954

"Hello. I was a regular customer at the Hall on Franklin for quite a while. I liked this place at first but then everything started going downhill. First, when I got sat at the table my glass was dirty with someone's lips print on it and all over the table I could have seen pieces of green onions and rice. Next, I was waiting for my food for over 40 minutes and my sweet potato tots were undercooked and cold inside. Last (but not least), I gave them the last chance and brought my friends to join me for few
drinks. As it happened again, we were waiting for our food for over 30 minutes because the staff who run our food was running around after a rat! I could not believe my eyes when I saw this, I even got up of my table to ask if it was what I saw. What type of place is this? A RAT! AT THE FOOD PLACE! Where families with kids go to dine out. On top of that, our check was messed up with things we have never ordered! After all, I decided to speak to the manager (I think her name was Chelsea). She showed up in 20 minutes and on top of that never offered us an apology. She seemed like she did not care about the customers at all. Her attitude is not acceptable and very rude spoken. It was my last chance to get things right but I would have never expected higher management to be so careless. Over all, I will never come back to this place and would not recommend it to my worst enemy. Hopefully, after my review you will improve the place and the management team. #thehallonfranklin",-0.7601

"Mexican food that tries to be pretentious in the ritzy Palma Ceia area and falls flat on its face.

First of all, they serve you this weird, tiny fruit cup when you come in. NO chips and salsa. If you want it you have to pay FIVE dollars. Are you kidding me? Queso blanco is four dollars at Miguel's with unlimited chips!

All the meals nickel-and-dime you too. Prepare to pay 14 dollars for tacos with NO sides. Sides are extra. These people are crazy! The food is not good either. Not worth the price by a long shot. 

The worst part is the owner. Wow she's obnoxious. She has a Yelp account and she gets on here and bashes anyone who gives her restaurant a bad rating. I can't wait for her to bash me! Lady? Take a management course or hand the restaurant over to someone who isn't an arrogant loudmouthed a-hole like you. 

This place will be closed in six months. And the owner will be crying and wondering why people did this to her wonderful authentic restaurant. Wake up and read the real reviews, not just the ones your friends posted to boost the rating. This place sucks.

PROS:

Decor is a mediocre attempt at ""trendy""
That's it

CONS:

You'll give more nickels and dimes here than you'll give to the Salvation Army bell man
Bad food
The. Owner. Is. Obnoxious. 
Not worth the price at all

VERDICT: Are you kidding me? I wouldn't go near the owner with a thirty foot long pole! Stay away, far away.

****EDIT**** Apparently the loco owner thinks that anyone who gives her restaurant a bad review is just another account of a troll who has it out for her place. Look at her response to Elizabeth's review. SO unprofessional. Also I'll add that we are NOT the same person, just two people who think her restaurant sucks like a mosquito. AND the owner is having friends write good reviews of this place to boost the rating. You can tell because the reviews of ""Jane"" and ""Tracy"" all have terrible grammar throughout, just like the owner's grammar when she comments...hmmm....

And lastly, why would I waste my time creating different accounts for a restaurant that'll be closed soon regardless? The owner is a looney toon and she should be committed. She should be about as near to the customer service industry as I should be to the top of Mount Everest. Hint: I'm afraid of heights. 

****EDIT EDIT**** Hmm, ""Jane""s review has mysteriously disappeared. I wonder why? Maybe because the owner knows we see through her game? You know lady, someday you're gonna run out of email addresses to create all these fake accounts. And friends to write fake reviews. Your restaurant sucks; 95 percent of people don't like it. Admit it and take your ""authentic Aztec recipes of your grandmother"" and shove them up your piehole. Come back when you've learned a little humility.

The man making my salad in the back came out 3x before asking for payment, informing me that ""my card was declined"".  I indicated online that I was paying with cash, so he obviously had the wrong customer and called me out for something that was not my problem.  As I stood waiting for the salad, at least 5 people were checked out, so I could have not ordered online, gotten in line with everyone else and made it out in the same amount of time-probably less.  When I expressed this to the people at the register, they completely ignored me-no ""I'm sorry"" or comp of any kind, just ignored me.  

If I can't get timely service (some of us have JOBS that require that we are not gone for long, which is why I order online) and at the very least an apology, then I wont take my business there, and I will make sure none of the vast numbers of people I come into contact with do either.

Every item we ordered tasted like it was made by a completely different restaurant... so as a whole they must not have any standards between locations. We ordered online and picked up in store, and if I would not have checked my order nor asked, they would have forgotten our drinks and the extra sour cream we paid for. The empanadas are amazing at the MLK location and completely underwhelming at this location; the shape, size and flavor are night and day. My ""two taco dinner"" had jalapeños, which I did not add, and rice inside the tacos, which I did not want; I asked for rice and beans on the side and there weren't even any beans. Also, there were so many jalapeño slices mixed in, it made my tacos so spicy I couldn't eat them. My boyfriend's quesadilla was as he ordered, but he was underwhelmed compared to the many locations he has been to. The queso was too spicy to eat, despite us both liking their queso and having it at other locations AND we both don't mind spicy. We will probably order from other locations again but never this one.

After we had ordered margaritas and quesadillas and were waiting to pay, we again had to wait for almost 40 minutes to ask the waiter for our check. There was no one to be found in the restaurant. It wasn't busy so there was no excuse. When we went to pay, the waiter told me that the credit card machine has been down so they needed to write down our credit card number and expiration date and charge me later when the machine was fixed!! ABSOLUTELY NOT!!! I told them I felt uncomfortable writing down my credit card information and the waiter told me that I needed to go to the bank and get cash out to pay my tab. I again said absolutely not! He should have told us as soon as we sat down that it was cash only for the night, so I was not wrong for saying no! The waiter then insulted me by saying that I was trying to get out of paying my bill (which was only 30 dollars) I said that I had no problem paying for the bill as evidenced by me handing him my American Express earlier and that now was extremely offended by the insult that I can't afford a 30 dollar tab!!! The owner came up and said that she didn't know what to say but that we needed to go to the atm and get cash out! I explained to her the situation, that her wait staff never informed me about the credit card machine being broken and it is not my fault that their equipment was faulty.

I was floored! I said not only will I not do that, I will not ever come back to this place again due to the poor service, miscommunication and blatant disrespect for their customers!

"Extremely disappointed here. Waited 10 minutes for a table and they were not busy as all. Came in for brunch on a Sunday. Ordered a Bloody Mary & got tomato juice with no flare. For $$$. 

Need more variety. 

I'd only come back for after work drinks, dinner will be somewhere else. 

Beautiful building and decor.",-0.5563
"Longest I've ever waited in line at a Chipotle. Not even at lunch or dinner time! The line was out the door and yet staff exhibited absolutely no sense of urgency. They idled around and chatted nonchalantly as those still in line hovered impatiently. It's as if the staff at this chipotle exist in a dimension outside of the one in which the patrons of this establishment exist. I don't even know how else to describe it. Also, our chips were quite stale!",-0.6982
"So not worth it! Order taker Kiki not very friendly. First time here and last time. The burrito prenado...strange flavors. And no chips come with the burrito!",-0.7631

"I don't typically like to review chain restaurants, but this Chipotle location is unusually substandard. They are always understaffed and out of ingredients like chipotle vinaigrette. You would think that being located near a college campus would cause a high turnover rate of the meat and toppings; however, that is not the case here. There have been many occurrences of getting a bowl where the meat is no longer hot and the toppings are no longer cool. This location is not representative of the Chipotle franchise. I would recommend going to the Bruce B. Downs location.",-0.3859
"Terrible service and check you bill! They never brought the queso and I asked to have it removed. Then at checkout I was charged anyway. It was crossed out and I heard him yell back in to inquire about it not knowing I spoke Spanish. He said to charge it anyway. I will never return.",-0.636
"Great concept, in theory. Went twice. First time was on a Friday night with my mom. Seating, ordering and ultimately getting food and drinks is confusing and more heartache then it's worth. Gave them a second chance on a Sunday afternoon. More of the same, however this time around I was ignored at the hostess station and a couple different standing room bar spots. I finally found a spot in the back by the oyster bar and was abruptly told to move by a server, a small guy with black rimmed glasses. The only time I was spoken to was when I was told that I had to move, not a great look. Once again, great concept, but no one should be made to feel awkward or uncomfortable when trying to find a place to sit/stand. I hope they get it together. Food is good though!",-0.1496
"Completely awful, bad service and ride manager. I ordered the taco salad which they forgot the gauc for and they only put a small handful of lettuce with a huge portion of bad flavored taco meat. Do not go here ever.",-0.8608
"the only reason I gave it one star is because the bartender, Cat...tried to make our time there more enjoyable and she brought me my second philly steak and cheese after I sent the first one back. I had ordered it with no onions and apparently that ment give me burnt beef jerky on an uncut bun. As a chef, you shouldn't serve people a sandwich that you wouldn't eat yourself. the second sandwich that cat brought to me was a completely different sandwich, it was better but honestly...we paid $36 for two sandwiches, fries, a side of queso and a rootbeer float. Thats insane. we were told there was a 20 minute wait by what appeared to be 4 hostesses at one hostess stand. then one of them took us to a couch right beside the bar. Told us the run down..we could sit there..a server would come...or order at each place individually. we sat for about 10 minutes deciding what to eat. a server never came. i ordered our food at one spot and drinks at one spot. never got a text to come get said drinks. not sure what the protocol was there. walked to get my rootbeer float I was told that it was where I ordered it walk back to that station they told me a server had just left with it I stayed there for a few minutes until the server who would walked around with my cold root beer float finally found me and handed it to me at the first place where I ordered it which was not where the root beer float was supposed to be picked up. Then I got my husband's Diet Coke from the bar area because the server that did come to us finally brought us plates and napkins and water but never retrieved my husband's Diet Coke. Then I did receive a text to go get my food my husband sandwich was good the Jimmy 2 times and my Philly steak and cheese was inedible. i walked back to the first place I ordered it.... requested the second sandwich... went back to the bar to get my husband a refill of his diet coke and that's when I said what I had to say to Cat and she retrieved my sandwich and tried to make things better. But I'm not a server and I didn't come there for work day. This system is flawed....even when I tried to tell the people they were out of a sauce the guy behind that counter told me I had to go tell the fish and chips people about the sauces because they were the ones who made them. I did not because I don't work there.... it was a weird thing for him to tell me to go do that ...
If I ever go back it would be at night. to drink. maybe chat with the nice bartender, Cat, but other than that it was incredibly loud and i didnt enjoy it. The food we had was just okay, and would have cost me 1/3 of that in any food court. it was 12:15 when we got there. we had to park 2 blocks away. In the hood. there are homeless people peeing on sidewalks in broad daylight. right across from where i had to park. Poor prep and expectation of clientele because I made my order at 12:15 and they were out of the lobster corn nuggets, which was really the only thing i came there to try. Was not impressed with the overall experience. Probably wont recommend it to anyone.",-0.7773
"Ordered the Azteca soup. I felt something was wrong but thought nothing of it. When I went home, I ended up throwing up 5 times, other stomach issues, and had a fever the next day. My guess was that it was the shrimp. I though the soup was scorching hot... Must have heated it up to disguise how old it was.",-0.5499
"Called in an order at 2:54 pm over the phone they said 10 mins and I waited til 3:20 for my food which was only a side dish when I went to the window to ask about my order the girl rudely said it's almost up and closed the window. When she opened the window to give me my food didn't say thank you or sorry for the wait or anything. Definitely will not return if this is how you treat a customer no matter how the food tastes!!",-0.4393
"This place has to be the worst Taco Bell I've ever had. It started when the lady running the drive-thru was yelling at the cars in front of me. I thought it was late so maybe they were being rude slightly intoxicated college kids but I was wrong! She talked to everyone like that. She told the first car to ""Hurry up we ain't got all day"" and the second car "" That's what I said if you would listen to me"". I was shocked to say the least. The food was bad too. I heard her yell through to the guys in the back. ""You are burning something!!! Turn that the hell off!!! What is wrong with you?!"" I should have known it was my food since I was waiting at the window. The quesadilla was burnt to a crisp and they didn't say a word. As soon as I drove away I could smell it :( Needless to say... my meal was a bust so I just threw it away. Avoid this place at all costs!!",-0.9867
"We arrived, found ourselves a table as we were told to.  We found a sever who began to clear our table.  Within the 15 minutes we were at the table waiting to order our drinks at least 3 servers past us.  We ended up leaving.  What a horrible experience I can see why Green Limon is slammed and they are NOT.

They were understaffed and not ready for such a large night they were having compared to what in told usually is.  Not impressed, horrible service as far as I see it.",-0.8428
"Mediocre food, poor service and deceptive pricing made for a disappointing brunch experience.  The wait staff was poorly trained and rude.  Each of our plates came out separately, five minutes apart.  I requested salsa for my bland egg sandwich and was told that it would be a $1 upcharge for a small plastic cup.  The salsa was $2 on the bill, and my toddler's juice that the waitress claimed was ""included"" was $4.  We will not be back.  It's a shame because we like to support local businesses, and we enjoyed the unique artwork and décor.",-0.5994
"Went in for lunch and sat in the bar area. Bar smelled disgusting. 1 server taking all tables at lunch 3 out of 4 salsas at the salsa bar were bland. House margaritas were not good at all.

"Avoid if at all possible. Always sooo slow and the employees literally will leave their post on the line and go do something else and then wonder back all while you're standing there waiting to be helped. They are always low on food and I usually get a vegetable bowl and I have to ask two or three times for more vegetables because they literally put three vegetables into the bowl at a time. Very frustrating. It's also always dirty, I never eat in the store.. and it stinks so bad like not Mexican food.. like rust.. wait why do I ever eat here?",-0.8892
"If the option was available for zero stars that would have been selected. Absolute worst experience ever. Maria is the worst manager ever. I called in order for 4 bowls for carry out and EVERY order was wrong. No consideration was made and 2 hours were wasted trying to get a refund or get the order corrected. NEVER again will I waste my time with this chipotle!",-0.9399
"Good food, shitty service ruins the experience. Even for pickup orders they are extremely slow. So if you don't mind an extra 20 min wait, you'll enjoy. If you hate the wait go somewhere else, maybe another chipotle. They'll most likely be faster.",-0.6249
"Everytime they are out of something and behind cooking it.... Every time I tip I can't even get a thank you.... This time I gave the tip to the homeless lady on the way in.... At least she said thank you.... Of course I did not eat here ended up walking out.... They were out of onions & peppers again.... And out of steak and just started cooking it.... Where's management? You know when you're running low to start prepping/cooking BEFORE you run out of anything.... Will I come back here.... Probably not...",-0.6508
"What can I say? I am not sure if it was just this location or every Chipotle in the whole US. I literally waited in line for 27 minutes and this was around 3:30pm. When I am ready to order my food, I felt entirely rushed. How was I supposed to know what to order if I had never had never been here before? Literally every person working in each station was rushing me and not polite at all. It almost seemed as if they were annoyed. When I get to work to finally eat my food, I was extremely disappointed. Not as good as everyone says it is. I ordered their burrito and it was not good at all. I would rather pay $7 for a real burrito from an actual Mexican restaurant. The only thing good here were the chips. I would never in my life step foot in another Chipotle again. I think this place is completely overrated.",-0.9087
"It's a Taco Bell, so I don't expect much, but damn. Food wise it's a decent Taco Bell, but the service is so horrible. I've spent 45 min in the drive through, and the worst part is there's no escape route- so you're stuck there, even if you decide that $3 burrito isn't worth an hour wait. I just spent 10 minutes in the drive through, most of which was spent waiting to give my order. Eventually, people started blaring their horns at me, so I just drove up to the window, where I was told they couldn't take my order and I had to drive around again. Really tho?",-0.9581
"Fun salty low quality snack enjoyment is constantly being down graded by corporates ever squeezing hand to regulate the serving amount Yes serving us less for the same price makes you more money but who tf wants the awkward disillusionment of feeling lucky or cheated as the server looks awkward trying to judge every shred of meat. And worse in this case where she over and underserves serves every other person depending on protein served, to try to make up. It's a low budget restaurant. Stop trying to screw your customers to feed the stock holders I just want a salty snack once in a while and not have to think about why ur jerks and your accounting problems. You make a lot of money and your alienating your client base to ""improve"" by 1-2%. And no I don't care if that 1-2% is worth several hundred thousand. Your a restaurant not a vending machine. Why don't you convert to pre weighed baggies or paper boats u creepy sleepy corporate fs or make it in the back like the crap McDonald machines you are.",-0.9661
"Food was bland with very little meat. Quantity was very small and everything was WAY overpriced. Large fee for chips and salsa ($5). Come on, this is a mexican restaurant, make with the chips.

"My wife and had gone here many times in the last few months. Good food, attantive staff. But this time was absolutely awful. 
They broke one of my pet peaves for this type of bussiness. They seat almost 12 people at a table just before us in a section so far from us that the waitress can't can't serve our food in a reasonable amount of time and when we get it it cold. It was just as good as really bad tv dinner.

"Ok food, horrible service. Our server should find another career. Twice we attempted to dine here over the past 3 months and both times the same server was the one of the worst I've ever had in my 40 plus years of dining experience in Tampa.
Yes, we went here using a groupon but with between 25-30 dining groupons used all over Central Florida in the past 5 years, this establishment is consistent with the worst service.
The server went on to make me feel inferior by ignoring my request on literally 3 occasions. He must have issues with woman which is pathetic because I'm the tipper not my husband.
Management was worthless when trying to advise of the poor service and we will NEVER return, EVER.
If I could give zero stars, that would be my review grade. 4 thumbs down from me & hubby.",-0.9836
"We had a table of 9 on cinco de mayo, so I assumed service was going to be off but I didn't imagine it would be this bad. Once seated we were given chips and salsa, which was great. However, it took 20 min just for a server to come over and get our drink order. I noticed that all the servers were looking and talking about our table, but nobody wanted to take us. Since we were sitting for quite a while we were ready to place an order too, but our server said ""no, drinks first"". Okay. Once we got our drinks, which were in solo cups, it took another 20 min for her to come back over and ask for our order. At this point, we were all fed up with waiting and we asked for our checks for the drinks and left.

"Breakfast

This review is only about the breakfast.  Precious wanted a bite to eat before taking off.  She saw this place.  She got a bowl with scrambled eggs and what they portrayed as chorizo, but let me tell you, it really wasn't chorizo.  It was more like the taco meat from Taco Bell, spicy ground beef.

The eggs were below average, no salt, no taste.  The chorizo [sic] was as described above.  It's one of those meals that you regret having.  There are only so many calories one can eat without getting fat, and we wasted 500 plus or minus on that.

Also, a heads up, I strongly recommend NOT eating here outside of the peak lunch and dinner time.  The food is precooked, and it sits for who knows how long before it is served.  With an inexperienced staff or on a slow day, that can sit there long enough to get nasty.  Usually during the peak periods there's enough turnover that you don't have to worry about it.",-0.6653
"Do not eat here!  Run far & fast!  Was there for dinner on Feb 22 & spent the entire next day at the ER due to food poisoning!  Was never so sick in my life!  I thought it weird when the owner came out of the kitchen wearing shorts & flip flops!  Are you kidding me?  This is not a beach restaurant!  Luckily nobody else in our party got sick, but only 1 of us got the shrimp dish. I will never be back, & neither will our family members that live in Tampa.  I would not recommend this restaurant.",-0.9318
"This is quite possibly the worst Taco Bell in the country. Anytime after 8pm you'll wait 20 min in the drive-thru for your order. I will say they're friendly but doesn't make up for the lack of ""fast-food"". Corporate should let them add extra staff at nighttime so they can stop pissing off so many customers.",-0.8828
"I was very disappointed.  The food was definitely NOT authentic.   The burritos were filled with tons of rice and service was very slow.  The only good things that were the chili rejenos and the hotter sauces.  The blender was broken so we could not get the mole. It was all gringo food. Even the margaritas were a mix with little alcohol. We were very disappointed to get an $80 check for 4 of us with food that was not authentic.",-0.647
"Unfortunately, only one star because I told the server I was a vegan and decided on the avocado toast with no hot sauce. It showed up with hot sauce and smothered in butter which I didn't realize until I took a bite. It was bland for anyone who wouldn't have cared about the butter or hot sauce. The bread was untoasted white bread with no textural interest.",-0.7212
"I decided to come to this chipotle after 3 years of not having it. I came around 6pm, which of course was right in the middle of their dinner rush. Ordering was quick and easy, but I was put off by the employees attitudes. They all looked miserable, and I honestly felt bad for them. I ordered a burrito with brown rice, black beans, chicken, sour cream, and queso. The first issue was that I had to wait 5 minutes for the queso. No big deal, I just sat at a table and waited. Once the queso was ready however instead of getting my attention, or walking it over to me my queso just sat in a Togo container until I realized I had been waiting for a while and inquired about it. To me that's just not good customer service. Anyway, I go home with my food and finally sit down to eat it. I take one bite of my burrito and was definitely disappointed. The rice wasn't cooked all the way so it was hard, leaving me unable to eat my burrito. Then I decided to eat my chips, I take one bite of a chip and it is stale. It seemed as if it had been sitting out for hours on end. I tried multiple chips in the bag to make sure it wasn't just that one chip, but nope all of them were stale. So thank you for chipotle for making me waste over $10 on a meal that I couldn't even eat.",-0.7517
"Of the three times my husband and I have tried to eat here, this was the first we were actually able to. Both of the other times, they were closed during the day for whatever reason. Anyways, we got in line behind about 40 people, but stayed because we were really craving their food. After waiting about 20 minutes, we were finally able to order. Our order wasn't very complicated, a carnitas quesadilla with a side of sour cream, steak burrito and chips and guacamole to go. Now I understand they were busy, it was a Saturday at 2:30 and I get the lunch rush thing, but when we got home, some food was missing (the sides of guacamole and sour cream) and my quesadilla had been mixed up with a previous customer. We were both very disappointed with the service we had received and will not be returning to this location.",-0.8121

"Taco Tuesday is a time for laughter and happiness with loved ones. Catrinas left me with a hole in my heart that tacos generally fill. Starting off by the lack of proper air conditioners, they really gave an authentic feeling of sitting in a desert in Mexico. Struck by the heat the only logical thing to do was order a margarita. The waitress suggested a house margarita. But my parched mouth was greeted by some vile liquid that was basically glorified salt water with a lime garnish. The tacos were sad and the meat lacked flavor. All I could taste was the tortilla. The only redeeming factor that saved me from going home absolutely starving was the guacamole and chips. This guac was five stars, too bad the chef's skills didn't transfer over to anything else. Last but not least the service was terribly slow. When we arrived we were one of three tables, yet the wait time for our food was ridiculous.",-0.9336
"SO DISGUSTED! 
The following took place last night 5/2/2014. 

I would like to say that I had the worst experience at this place. Ordered large nachos and discovered after eating half of them I was eating a PLASTIC BAG melted in into the chips and cheese. WTF!!! 
How do you miss that when making nachos. This was the size of a ziplock sanwhich bag. I brought our waitress over to see which she replied ""how did that get in there?"" Asked to speak to the owner which I have seen on many other occasions wandering around aimlessly. Our waitress said ok and took the plate away. Oh yeah, she never came back, no owner nothing. 
I had to ask a busser where the owner or manager was and please go get to discuss this matter. Our waitress comes back declaring she's the manger and that the owner is not in WTF!! REALLY?!? She said since it looked like I was almost done (which I wasn't) that she figured I didn't want anything else as a replacement or that it would be taken off the check. NOTHING was done. Come on people a plastic bag melted in my food and not even an apology!? Never again and I'm sure that
1. The owner will never see this
2. This will be deleted. 
Beware!!!",-0.9055
"Moving from Boston to Tampa, I was not expecting much to be the same. One day driving to work, though, I saw Chipotle. A must have! I walk inside and order a chicken quesadilla. I then go to pay for my meal, although it seemed a little high, and voilà! My chicken quesadilla was done and put in front of me. Confused, I politely told the woman whom rung me up, Lisa, ""I'm sorry, but I did not say what I wanted on the quesadilla."" Apparently, in Tampa it is absurd to ask for lettuce, tomatoes, and all of the other usual's on a quesadilla, because ""wanting items on it is not a quesadilla, but it is now a burrito."" I then remind Lisa that I do not want a burrito; I want a quesadilla. She then proceeds to walk away from the counter. Never have I ever ordered from Chipotle and a) had a ruder employee, b) was never asked if they could fix the problem, and c) honestly, who simply wants chicken and cheese on their quesadilla? To top it off, I was charged extra chicken, when I never asked for that. I ended up leaving frustrated and with a $7 cheese and chicken quesadilla with no sour cream, no Chipotle sauce, and nothing in it. Needless to say, I will not visit Chipotle anymore, but instead I will find a Moe's and/or Qdoba.",-0.9528

A pitcher of beer was ordered and only 1 mug was provided, after another 10 - 15 minutes the server asked for our orders & when another mug was requested she walked away, came back 5 minutes later to drop the mug and disappear again. It was over 45 minutes before we were able to get her to take our meal order. Apparently they were out of shrimp and instead of communicating this, chicken was substituted and not even mentioned until we questioned the dish. The ""tostaguac"" tostada shell was a store bought hard taco shell broken in half and completely soggy when it arrived, topped with poor quality, misappropriates flavored ground beef. Their stuffed poblano was topped with a  tomato sauce that was overly seasoned with Italian oregano and not much else. I won't continue with the rest of the negatives...

Unfortunately, I can not say the flavor or the quality of the food outweighed all previous cons I listed. Nothing on my plate was cooked properly.

"I don't know where to begin. It took 45 minutes to get an unsweet ice tea. Two of the six dinners had to be sent back once for being cold. Another had to be sent back twice for being cold. They forgot to give us plates and after 20 minutes and 3 different requests, we finally got plates that they apparently were storing in the freezer because they were ice cold. After an hour and a half my kids still didn't get their chicken fingers. We were told that they were taking longer than normal so they changed their order to quesadillas for us. Thanks. Had to send them back and wait for what we actually ordered. When they came, we asked for ketchup. Another 15 minutes later and 3 requests they brought a small cup of tomato soup that they said was ketchup. In their defense, it might have been. It looked much too disgusting to actually try so we don't know what it was for sure. By the time we finally got the bill which we had to ask for several times, they discounted it 10% for the bad service. About $7. They told us it was because they were understaffed and s few other excuses. However, there were only 4 tables seated. If you can't handle 4 tables, there is seriously something wrong. What food we did get and could eat was very good. However, it was not worth the horrible service and insulting list of excuses we had to endure for over two hours.",-0.5608

The lard ass server we always wind up getting needs to quit eating there and sweating all over the place. It's real appetizing when he drops off the food and sweat drips on the table. The service sucks, food is mediocre at best, and the company hires garbage staff members. Good luck on your closing.",-0.048
"My family and I ordered through Postmates tonight which are always awesome and on time!  We ordered 4 items tonight for our family of four and two of the items were half made.  My daughters kids meal was missing the cheese from the cheese quesadilla and my burrito was less than half the size of their normal burrito.  Very disappointing.  I called the store to see if they would at least replace my child's order or refund it and they stated we had to come to the store even though not was ordered through Postmates! Very disappointed 7 year old to boot :(",-0.8161
"Showed up over half an hour before closing and was locked out and after waiting at the door, the employees finally walked over and I asked if they were not closing at 12am as listed on the door and they said they decided to close early that night to prepare for an inspection the next morning and he proceeded to close the door with no further explanation. Not sure why any restaurant needs to prepare for inspections you should always be following proper food safe procedures.",-0.0675
"Very expensive for Mexican food.  I had the chimichanga and my son had the quesadilla. The chimichanga was good however we ordered chips and queso for an appetizer and the queso was so watery not at all like it should be.  The server said that is how queso is. I then told the server that I was a chef who has managed several restaurants throughout my career and this is not queso its 99% water 1% cheese and asked him to have the kitchen redo it as the main reason for trying this place was because my son wanted queso.   it was tolerable then but still poor quality.  The salsa was also horrible and tasted like it was out of a jar. Very disappointing There are several Mexican restaurants in the area that I would recommend this is not one of them. I am glad I had a Groupon and didn't spend  over $30 for myself and my son to eat at this restaurant. Poor quality over priced skip it",-0.9301
"I will NEVER come here again. We asked for a table for 7 people and as we sat down our server was talking to the people at the table next to us saying how he didn't feel like serving us. He continued to talk about how he just wanted to go home and how we had the nerve to show up at 8:30pm when his shift ended at 9:00pm and he just wanted to go home. He clearly looked at us while making all his rude comments, making it obvious that he was talking about us. We felt extremely uncomfortable and just left. As we were walking out he sarcastically said ""Bye!! Thanks for making my life a whole lot easier!"". I feel so disrespected and annoyed, never again.",-0.9024

Asked for salsa because so lacking flavor and she was going to charge for a red salsa... so not worth $1.50 per taco.",-0.9128

Then looked for a clean table but none had been cleaned. We ended up sitting at one of the hi-top counter and stool tables, which, with two small kids was not very good. The entire time we were eating no one ever came to clean the other tables. Then when we got our food, we had to wait another 5 minutes or so because there were no forks.

And I also thought the steak on my salad was different. Not seasoned well. 

Maybe we'll try a different location.",-0.9117

I always get attitude in return as well. doesn't matter who is working. Same outcome every time. Don't eat here unless you willingly want to be disappointed",-0.779

I ordered a burrito and asked for half chicken and half steak for my choice of protein, but the male worker kept insisting that if I wanted half and half meat, then he would charge me double the price. I cleared asked for half and half not 2 separate double scoops of meats. So, I re-asked him to confirm if this ""new"" policy, which I never heard of, only applied in this specific location and he said yes. I know that this is not true. The worker SHOULD NOT LIE to his or her customer. Absolutely terrible customer service. I lost credibility of this particular company. This event makes me sad that I did like Qdoba in the past. The female cashier was only interested in getting people out of the line. No eye contacts were made during the entire visit. I would never go here ever again.",-0.7606

What happened! The food was bland and mediocre but the service was horrible. Our waiter became visibly upset when we weren't ready to order our entrée when he came to get the drink order(about 2 mins after we sat down). The attitude became more obvious with sighs and grunts when asking questions. The topper was a head tilt and eye roll when someone asked for a drink refill. When he actually returned with the drink he slammed it on the table and walked away. I dont know what the waiters problem was but there are now 4 people that will never return to this place. Sad",-0.9628

We understand that serving us takes longer. But it has been unacceptable lately. A total of 45 minutes had passed and we were not even provided water. We had ordered our margaritas and tacos already and nothing. Btw: they have one blender where they make the frozen margaritas. We stopped a waiter and told them how we had not received anything. Another server comes and took all our order AGAIN. This makes me think our order was NEVER placed. ANOTHER 45 minutes pass and we had NOTHING!!!! it was a total of 1:30 hours waiting for food and even a drink. I have not returned since this occurred.",-0.8185

I ordered chicken tacos rice and beans. I had been here a couple times prior with no major issues so it's the only reason I went back. my last visit the wait was a bit longer then usual and then my chicken tasted sour.. I did end up getting sick so i won't be back even if it was a fluke.",-0.8047

Thought perhaps they were busy but once directed into the dining room found only two other tables were eating. Waited another 5 minutes before the server took out drink order. I happened to notice he was at the bar watching television. 

The chips and salsa were outstanding, as is always the case at Vallarta's. The rest of the food was decent. The service continued to be poor throughout the visit. In between prolonged intervals of no service our glasses sat empty and needed refilling. The server acted as if we were an inconvenience. Needless to say, I will not be returning to this location. I've never had a bad experience at any other location.",-0.2789

"Wow, what a disappointment. The service was horrendous. Our server was more interested in spending time at his friend's tables that he was checking on us, so we were ignored time and time again. The food was overcooked and under portioned, so much so that the expensive price we paid made the experience even worse. Not a single person from server to clerk to manager ever asked us how we liked our food or anything else. A long time ago we had a good experience here, but that has changed. Not a place we'll go back to.",-0.0349
"After this location did not get our order correct, I asked for a correction. The response was that they were busy and could not complete the order. Spoke with the manager and was told to have a nice life. All we wanted was to get what we ordered and paid for. Not too much, I don't think. Will not be ordering from this location anymore and would expect Taco Bus management to look at the leadership of this location.  Terrible.",-0.0772
"Terrrrible service! We waited over 35 minutes for 2 Tacos and a bowl. When we checked on our order, a short bearded guy was clearly annoyed by our inquiry. He told us our food was sent out by accident. Zero customer service! Finally we asked for a refund and we were given the biggest attitude and no apology. Dude told us Taco Bus didn't have enough money to hire anybody to help out, which again shows lack of training and customer service. Your excuses for poor customer service only reflects poorly on Mr. Beard.",-0.8065
"The initial exposure was good. We were told a 45 minute wait which took only 15. We were given one menu for all three of us. I thought this odd, but all became clear.  After 20 minutes with chips, I called over someone in a black shirt. I asked if they were our waiter.  They said no. I asked if they would like to be.  This started a long discussion between three people and eventually one came over to take our drink order. 


We did order, but food did not come for another hour. No one knew what was going on and obviously the staff was overwhelmed. After finishing, I could not get the Walter's attention and had to seek him out twice;  once to get the bill, and once to pay. 


It was a disastrous experience and don't blame the waitstaff. This was all management with too few waiters covering too large an area and too few in the kitchen. Food was average as well, but the poor service was the kicker. 


The women's bathroom was also atrocious with blood and urine all over the toilets (was okay at 6pm but terrible at 8:30pm).  There was water and urine all over the floor as well. Very unsanitary. 


Oh, and the reason the wait was less; the smarter people just got up and left.

"I tried the Vegan Salad and the Vegan Taco.
Two of the primary ingredients on both are ""seared"" tofu and Mushrooms. 
They need to change ""seared"" to ""wet sponge"" tofu, as in my many years of eating tofu this was by far the worst. It was literally like biting into a wet sponge and was barely palatable.

The mushrooms had a similar texture, but almost rubbery, and as a man who loves mushrooms, I did not enjoy these.

The only thing I did enjoy was the Kale Pesto- that was quite tasty.",-0.2454
"This place have a cafeteria style. Reserved seating is only for 2hrs then after you will be moved to the bar

Our waiter was Kristinna P and she was the worst no one at my table wanted to leave a tip. She seldomly came to check on us my meal was very dry which was the fries soft shell crab sandwich and by time she came and asked if there was anything that I needed my food was cold. So I asked for another entree instead and she seemed as if it was a problem. Advised that my sandwich is dry and she offered the mayo advised that would have been perfect when my food was still hot.  I also ordered the crab dip and she only brought out 2pack of salted crackers (total of four) I have to keep asking for more. 

Once you ask for you bill it's not presented to you until after you pay which I totally disagree with just for cases you don't know what your being charged for. In my case I had a bad experience. I paid for my tab the waiter gave my the receipt and quickly disappeared so I had to ask for management due to I was over charged and he had he fix it she brought me my receipt and walked back off.

Yes...really!  

To add insult to injury, after returning to work with my to go order I opened the supposed salad with chicken only to find a soupy mess inside.  No salad (no lettuce), 6 morsels of chicken, and pinto beans topped by a messy liquid soup of corn, veggies and a swimming pool of watery salsa.  I tried calling and calling the restaurant to no avail.  No one ever picked up the phone.  And I don't have 30 extra minutes on my brief lunch hour to return, wait in line and have the salad remade.

I placed my order no issue then asked how much was my total and this girl literally said ""I don't know""???!

Dining in: 
Slowest. Service. Ever..... It doesn't matter if the line is out the door, or if there are 10 people in line. You will still wait  30+ minutes.the staff is not welcoming, work as if they do not care about the job very much, and are rude when you ask for extra of something.

DON'T DO IT! My experience tonight is the reason this location is getting one star. I ordered online (3rd time attempting this) and my email confirmation said that my order would be ready at 6:30. I walked in at 6:31 to a line of people clustering the register waiting for their orders. I stood there for 10 minutes before  anyone acknowledged me. When the girl at the register finally asked me for my name, I told her and she continued to ring up people in the line. After 3 more customers, she told the bagging girl to go find my order. After she attempted to hand me someone else's bag, It turned out that my order was never made, nor was it even in the system. The register girl had me write down my order on a paper to be made. After 7 more minutes they finally gave me my order, but the dressing I ordered was not in the bag. So I asked for one and the register girl said ""sorry we're out.""

One of our group members ordered double steak, but really received triple rice and half a serving of steak. Several guests in the group asked for guac on top of their bowls and received actual pieces of avocado slices and and avocado peels. Doesn't sound like a big deal, except there were no plastic knives to cut up the slices. When sitting down, EVERY SINGLE TABLE was dirty. Only after cleaning the tables ourselves with the napkins that were within the original paper packaging, did the employee come out to clean the remaining dirty tables. Overall, food quality was poor in addition to the previously stated inconveniences. My friends and I are regular chipotle customers in our hometown, so we were happy to see one nearby.

Are you high ? Or confused cause it's in a KFC bag"" I Ignored her statement because I ain't got the time nor am I the one.

We really weren't impressed but towards the end of the meal my husband got a weird look on his face and spit something out. It was a metal shard. We think it must have been a shaving from opening a can though we can't be sure. He was pretty freaked out since he almost swallowed it.

It took over an hour to get our food, over 15 minutes for refills, and to top it off, my plate came out in a puddle of grease. I couldn't even eat it and I never send food back...I usually deal with it.  My husbands order was wrong but he ate it anyway.  I asked for a refill and never got it.  The rice was hard and cold.  The tacos came out with just beef.  No cheese on them.  The waitress brought out a side of cheese and she tried to do her best towards the end to fix it cause I'm sure she could see we were not happy.

She considered that a double chicken and double steak burrito, charging me for two scoops of chicken and two scoops of steak. She was so rude and had so much attitude towards me. 

The restaurant was so dirty and there was food all over the counters where they were preparing customer's food. The drink and condiment area was so messy and gross too. All of the tables had food on them so I had to sit outside. 

They had so many workers behind the counter doing nothing when they could have been cooking and preparing more food to go out to the line so that the girl didn't have to be scooping such small portions. They also should have had someone cleaning the lobby area.

All would have been fine if it wasn't for the manager coming back to the table--not to apologize--but to let us know that they inspected the plate and they determines that there was no hair. It's ridiculous because we all saw it and the manager took the plate away within seconds of putting it down. The professional response should have been we apologize and will take care of it. There is no point to argue with the customer unless you don't want those customers to return again--which she clearly did not. And we will be happy to oblige. Overall the food is okay but certainly not worth dealing with a poorly managed restaurant.",-0.2159
"HORRIBLE SERVICE!! The waitress was rude and didn't know how to explain the way the dishes were prepared. I am Mexican and wanted details bc people from different parts of Mexico or even Mexican-Americans prepare the same dishes differently. Then when I asked for an agua de melon she just stated ""no"". She didn't write anything down and forgot about things we asked for. When it was time to pay, she stated that she couldn't take my card bc my card had the chip and she did not know how to use it. Then she explained that the owner was not getting paid when his customers used the chip. She kept asking me if I had cash and stayed quiet when I said no. She was very rude and unclear. She also charged the other person I was eating with more than for what she ordered. Instead of changing the charge, she just asked if she would take another taco. I don't understand how they are running a business like this. They could easily place a sign on their door stating they only accept cash or that they do not accept cards with chips. They seem not to care about their customers at all. I will NOT be visiting this place ever again.",-0.8446
"We went to Catrina's for the first time around 1:30pm on a Thursday afternoon and the place was completely empty. It took at least 10 minutes to receive our margaritas from the bartender, who was busy chatting with someone at the bar. My boyfriend ordered the ""La Nina"" margarita and I ordered the ""Cilan Rita"" margarita; both were $9 for a house tequila-made margarita. When we finally did get our margaritas, they tasted like bad tequila mixed with very sour lime juice and water. We then ordered the Queso Fundido appetizer which had good flavor, but was made of mozzarella cheese, not the more authentic ""melted Oaxaca"" cheese that was listed on the menu. My boyfriend asked for a bottle of hot sauce (meaning Tabasco sauce or something similar) and was brought a tiny cup of their special hot sauce. He again asked for the bottle version but the server said ""this is our hot sauce"". We were later charged $2 for it. We were so disappointed with the margaritas that we did not order another. We then ordered the Chicken Tacos listed under the lunch specials. The tacos consisted of plain, non marinated, dry pieces of chicken with tons of chopped cilantro and a small amount of minced onions on them. That was it. We asked the waiter for some shredded cheese to put on the tacos and he brought us a tiny cup of shredded mozzarella cheese (obviously flavorless) and charged us $1 for it. Overall, the experience was flavorless, overpriced, and disappointingly not the typical authentic Mexican cuisine we are used to. We will not be back.",-0.8829
"Found hair in my food and was very rude about giving another one. Worker puts stuff without asking and gets mad when you say you don't want it and the rice is very sour!! I also found corn in my food when i did not ask for it.",-0.6844
"Chipotle is nowhere near real Mexican food - and the taste isn't much better than Moe's, Tijuana Flats, Qdoba, or other fast food Mexican joints. The price isn't cheap either at $9+ for a combo. What really turned me off was the service I experienced today while making my order. An employee rolled her eyes at me as I told her what I wanted in my burrito and had the nerve to tell me ""next time order things from left to right"" while rolling her eyes. Then when I took my order to the register - the cashier gave me a dirty look as well. The manager should watch who he hires to represent his franchise of this business. Eh, I don't think I'll be back.",-0.4949
"The food was terrible. My suggestion is to skip this place. It's hard for me to explain how terrible the food was so I attached a picture. All I can say is that I think they are making very good attempts to make people ill by eating their SLOP.",-0.7357
"This is the worst Taco Bell ever omg. I went here and pulled up to the drive through and the woman said something muffled, and I asked her to repeat what she had said because I couldn't hear her.

"Overpriced and bizarre. Corn tortillas, not free chips nor salsa, strange ambiance. This place has high end prices for a Mexican restaurant but absolutely nothing spectacular about their food. They are searching for an identity. I never write on here but felt compelled to since this place basically robbed me of $60. Dribk prices are reasonable. Food prices are ridiculous. Honestly, if you want high end Mexican, try Miguel's. If you want low end Mexican, try Estela's. If you want to pay a lot for nothing, eat here.",-0.2628
"First place I've walked out of before the server came.  Waited for five minutes and no one even looked at us. There were plenty working even two at the hostess stand. The air conditioning must have not been working as it was probably 80 degrees.  After all of that i didn't want to even try the food.  Hope they fix their problems as Brandon needs more restaurants.",-0.3009

"I like Taco Bus, went to the original a lot years ago.  The food is great and always well prepared. But I will never come to this location again due to rude and negative dispostion of the staff. The gentleman behind the counter was not very customer service oriented amd never smiled or made positive eye contact. I waited for my food for a while and watched as he either rolled his eyes or just ignored customers. In fact, he asked my girlfriend to go get ice from the gas station side for her drink because they ran out. What kind of service is this? My receipt says 1013pm and its now 1041 and I've still not gotten my food. In fact I'm just now told they're out of steak, when I have been here for 30mins. Come on Taco Bus, get it together. You have been in business for years. I will still eat at Taco Bus, but never at this location again.",-0.7118

"Big deal. Great space, but not for a great dining experience. Food from various places was good, but the service staff spoiled the entire visit. Staff should know the food and beverage options, he didn't, and they should be happy to be working there. He wasn't. Inattentive, belligerent, disinterested, uninformed waiter made our meal a trial. We ordered wine that never arrived, appetizers that were long in coming and wrong orders, and entrees that were served on top of our apps. That's when we ordered wine again. That we never got, again. Same for coffee afterwards. Guess beverages weren't this waiters thing, because the wine and coffees never arrived, and our water glasses were almost dry as a bone by the time we asked for the check. Such a shame. And servers wonder why they don't get 20% tips!",-0.0984
"We went last Tuesday around lunchtime. They were not that crowded, but it took forever to get waited on, and quite some time to receive our food. The kitchen seemed to be chaotic/disorganized, and it looked like there was no one in charge, and no one trained. I can't even imagine why it took so long...everything was pre-cooked. 

I ordered a grilled chicken burrito, and frankly ate about one-third of it. It was not edible. The flavor was bad, and that chicken hadn't even seen a fake grill printing on grill lines. Lay had gotten just some pork and rice. Even the pork was dry and lacked flavor. And it wasn't cheap. Sorry, we'll not waste another 55 mins. for lunch (or any time) at this place. They have a lot of work to do.",-0.1124

Chip basket was almost all crumbs from the bottom of the bag. 2nd basket was a little better but chips were really salty and not crisp. Salsa and guacamole not tasty. Had 2 shrimp tacos for my entree for $14. Also bland. Just very meh. Nothing special. Margaritas were also watery and not very flavorful. Very disappointing and waaaaaay overpriced. Chili's just as good. Avoid this place",-0.9443

Don't risk your safety at this unsanitary restaurant",-0.8744

"This place is horrible.   First if all what mexican restaurant doesn't have guacamole.   Really????  We order it with cheese dip, guy comes back and says sorry we have none.  I ordered chicken and steak fajitas.   Onions and peppers were burnt and chicken and steak dried out.  After they brought us our food, never see waiter again.  He never comes back to ask if we need refills or anything else.  Or to see if our order is ok.  Needed more sour cream, called out 2 or 3 times no response the waiter is chit chatting at the bar.  So my niece has to get up and walk over to the bar to ask him for what we needed.   We dont see him till he brings us the check.  He see's my plate and that I barely ate because it was horrible, he doesnt ask y i didnt eat my food or even ask  if i want to take it home.  He just picks up the plates and walks away.  Unbelievable.....At this point I'm disgusted.   Go to pay bill and let the young lady at the register know what a awful experience we had.  I get no apology and am told the gentleman that helped us is actually the owner.  Then Im told hes busy so thats why our service was bad.  Lol  What a joke.  Do yourself a favor  and stay away from this place its the pits.",-0.9268
"I am so frustrated and disappointed with this location. We have been customers for years because my son loves the tacos. On the way home from a trip tonight we grabbed some food. It was an online order and when we arrived the order was repeated back to us correctly. We got home and my son's 4 tacos were made incorrectly. He was tired, and frustrated and began crying. When I couldn't resolve the problem on my own, I drove back up to this location (after a 12 hour trip) to have them remake his tacos. The manager ""Christian"" was extremely rude and disrespectful. I asked for a refund also because I had to drive back up there to fix their mistake. He told me in front of other customers and staff that I was trying to steal money and that I could either have a refund or the tacos. I said, also now all of our other food is going to be cold as well. He actually had the nerve to tell me that I should of let my child cry while my husband and I ate our food and then come back to replace the tacos. It was extremely embarrassing as the whole staff and customers waited to see how I was going to react to this managers complete disrespect. This is the second time in a row our order has been messed up at this Taco Bell. Last time it we just dealt with it. We will no longer be eating at this location. If an owner or GM reads this message it would be in your best interest to hold  ""Christian"" completely accountable for this situation, as he lacks the ability to handle customer service situations and clearly demonstrates a lack of leadership skills in front of staff and customers.

Her BOSS the OWNER MARIANA got in her face and told her she would not pay my sister the full amount earned money she worked for while smiling and taunting. She proceeded to call the cops for no reason at all. The cops immediately advised them that there was nothing they could do and left. Too much unnecessary drama from an emotional unstable woman.

I'm not expecting anyone to be passionate about working in a fast food establishment but I do expect them to at least do the minimum required of their job title.

"Went to here for my first meal visiting Tampa and the service was horrible unlike the service I'm use to in NY. Came in to order a rice bowl with chicken. When we got to the chicken part, the container was pretty much gone and only small scraps of chicken left over and clearly needed to be refilled but she continued to try to give me the run out shredded chicken. I said I don't want that and let me get steak. She said that it's at 10 min wait for the steak. I was in a time crick and said what!!! This is crazy you guys are suppose to have things ready and refilled. So proceed to wait and so of the other two people. Once the steak was finally chopped she then used my waiting rice bowl and asked another person what they wanted on MY rice bowl!!! I butted in to excuse the worker of her mistake. She then had the nerve to ask me ""so u don't want it"" nooooo you clearly put topping on my rice bowl that I did not want. So by her mistake she had to Throw out an whole rice bowl and do another one. These two girls was such in a rush for no reason that they messed up ppl orders and throwing away food.

I kindly asked if we could have it re rapped but I was told it's a health violation to take food back an they could give me a tortilla to re rap it myself as if i didn't pay for it!!!

My husband had the shrimp and grits and the grits were bland. Ugh. I wanted to like this place.",-0.7717
"Terrible service! Walked for a reservation and it waited 10 minutes while the manager/owner took a social media picture. After the wait we waited longer as they cleaned the table in an empty restaurant. We sat down and waited another 10 minutes before anyone asked if we wanted water. In conclusion, the service was poor. The menu didn't have any alterations. Even tacos. We left and went to an authentic Mexican restaurant with better customer service",-0.6588

The lady was so dumb she forgot I asked for hot sauce and asked again what sauce I needed then proceeded to give me mild sauce.  I actually went back in to get hot sauce and the cashier didn't even apologize for his co-workers mistake. I should have complained about the crunchwrap too but didn't want another one from there for fear that they may spit in my food.  I really should have just returned it.

I had originally asked for pork belly, but she told me they were out of pork belly. A lil while later, after already placing my order, she came and said more pork belly was available, and when she brought the tacos there was only a very small amount of meat. $105 later, after 4 margaritas and 9 tacos.

Since I'm from out of town and didn't know what to expect, I was hoping for some good, authentic Mexican food. I was very disappointed. The food was very bland and lacked spice and flavor except for an overwhelming cheesy sauce that was on my chimichanga. I don't recommend this place.

"This restaurant has a cool/trendy look, but the food was bland and not worth the price.

The staff acted like they could care less that we were there and while we were seated promptly, we were basically ignored other than quick drop offs of food. The fact that the waitress didn't seem even remotely surprised that we barely touched the nachos or that we asked for them to be taken off our bill tells me that this is probably a daily occurrence at this place. Also, we had a waitress who wasn't ours randomly bring us 3 extra plates before we even ordered and tell us they were out of napkins, even though a third server brought us napkins at random well after our food was delivered? It was really just a sad and disappointing (and slightly confusing) experience. I don't even know how you can mess up nachos. Mind boggling. We won't be back. :(",-0.1648

I also was charged for 2 bowls and I only go one the total was like 15 and some change the girl knew I only had one bowl and wasn't going to tell me she overcharged me until I asked for my receipt!!! Horrible service I will never visit here again!!!!",-0.9355
"This food was not good... AT ALL! 
I ordered the 2 Taco special: one chicken and one pork... The tacos were ice cold. My friend ordered a taco as well and his was frozen cold too. Not enough salsa for the chips and I ordered an additional cheese sauce for $2 Extra and there still wasn't enough. Needless to say, I am extremely disappointed in the quality of the food I received. 
I will NOT be going back here and I do NOT recommend this place... What a waste of money smh.

The hostess said they had no tables but that they had a sofa. For as expensive as the food is, we need a table to eat. I told her no. I asked if the building had a second floor? Again, she was confused so I repeated my question two more times. She looked at me confused. So I asked her if we could be placed on a waiting list. She said yes but that there was no time estimate. I gave her my information and she still looked confused. So I asked her, is anyone else before us on the wait list? She said yes.

The so called bartender waiter along with the rest of the staff an old waiter and a younger one were all sitting at a table in the middle of the bar area eating and not paying attention to customers. I am sure the health dept would shut them down. Filthy place that needs to be closed. Taco bell would of been better. We had to chase them down to pay and was never checked on. The only thing ok was the soup on the salad bar.  Bonnie and Roy from NH",-0.6197

"Since we don't live in the area we had not been to Vallarta's in a long time.  We came as a party of 7 and when we walked in we stood and someone told us that we needed to move out more to be seen by the staff. Odd but we complied. It took awhile to get our seats though it was half empty despite being a Saturday evening. When we finally were seated it was two tables moved together (no problem) but they were very crooked and it felt weird. Also, behind us for most of dinner was a rolling cart filled with bins of dirty dishes. We had three different people help us with ordering as 5 of us were not ready to order. One server took our friends orders and then we waited a long time before a manager finally came to assist and he took the rest of our order down. Not long later we received our 5 meals plus a side and our friends waited a very long time before we asked about their meal. All of our meals were very cold, dry and tasteless and the guacamole tasted quite weird and looked weird too. I didn't notice til the end of the meal that they subbed one of the Chile Relenos with Rice and beans without asking. When our friends got their food it was nice and warm but they complained as they ordered a meatless meal that it was nearly all lettuce. The meal described sounded much different and was not what I expected. They seemed hungry when we left. We did all eat because we were on a time crunch and had no time to send food back or go somewhere else. I do like the decor, some very nice appeal with that but what a shame they have custom painted walls and they put ads on them for a new dish and paint was being peeled off from the tape. I'm sure the wall art was very costly and it looked tacky with taped ads. I just want to note that there were no females at all working this night only men. My husband felt this was a sign that management was difficult as he feels men put up with more. On another note, they charge extra for extra salsa or chips. Most Mexican restaurants give those freely. Another important note... the ladies bathroom smelled very very disgusting, so bad I nearly wanted to leave and looked like it had poop on the walls near the paper towels...a huge amount... Lastly, They have you wait in a line off to the side of the restaurant where you first come in to pay. You wait in line a very very long time to pay.

She also stood there while we paid watching us choose the tip, frankly in a bit of an intimidating manner.  The tip machine defaults to 20% so if you wanted to change it she would be standing there watching.  It is truly very sad bc they have a lot of opportunity based on their location to really blow it out of the water.  Also, the restaurant isn't very old and you can tell they don't really care about the general maintenance.  I will never go back to this place and any chance I have I'll share my horrible experience.",-0.4862
"I understand this is a new restaurant but it does not mean that it's ok to have extremely rude children as employees. After waiting over 30 mins for a couple of tacos they forgot my sour cream and tried to charge me twice for it. I honestly wouldn't recommend going here unless you don't care about cold food. Compare this to an expensive Taco Bell. If you complain the owners just argue back with you very unprofessional.",-0.9431

The plates didn't even include rice or bean they were extra charge. 9. Ordered a steak ranchero and no flavor had to add salt to get a little taste out of it 10. Ordered a shrimp QUESADILLA and plate came back with a Shrimo Taco and no rice and no bean and GUACAMOLE, so I asked at least for som pico de gallo and I was fckn charge. 11. Owner is very RUDE.

"Let me be more clear: ZERO STARS
I know it's Taco Bell and what can I really expect but Chick Fila knows service and this Taco Bell does not. I am a decent human being who went to Taco Bell to order food for myself as well as two colleagues. My colleagues had a couple of special requests like ""no tomatoes"" and make the beef the ""baja"" kind but nothing crazy or difficult. Upon arriving in the drive thru, right away I knew I was going to have problems. I asked for the Nacho Grande Box and was told they don't have it. Then I asked for the quesarito and again they didn't have it. I moved on and ended up skipping my order entirely and ordered 2 of the #6 Chicken Chalupa meals and asked for beef in one and the normal chicken in the other and the staff said ""I can only ring it up as beef."" Then I said well, the menu says it has chicken and she said ""ugh, how can I explain this to you, I can ONLY ring it up as beef."" Of course I was perplexed when it is called a CHICKEN chalupa but figured, ""hey, maybe I'm a moron"" and moved on asking for two chicken quesadillas and drinks and to please complete one of those meals without tomatoes. She repeated it back to me, correctly but when I got to the window I did not receive a second quesadilla so I asked about it and a different woman said it wasn't on the order. I asked to have it added and the first woman popped around and said ""This is going to throw the order off"" and ""I'm done with it"" in earshot of me. I could not believe how rude she was and if there had not been a giant lunch line of other poor souls like myself I would've given her the Karen treatment if you know what I mean. Sadly, I did not get her name so I can drag it through the mud properly....  I came back to work with the food to find out, there was no chicken in the chicken chalupas and the taco shells were stale and my poor coworkers felt the need to call the corporate office to complain on my behalf since they felt badly over how I was treated and the fact I was so upset I lost my appetite completely. We don't think calling the corporate office will do any good so here I am to warn others- just go to Chick Fila. I know sometimes you wanna go South of the Border but you could ask them for tacos and they'd probably try to give them to you despite not having such things when Taco Bell who specializes in them will give you stale ones with beef when you wanted chicken and basically tell you to f off. Oh, and if anyone who runs the place cares, it was whoever was assigned to drive thru order taking at 12:43pm today 10/14. Write her up.",-0.838

The coffee was awful, it tasted like hotel room coffee and was not hot at all. The ""orange juice"" was simply water with a hint of juice. We ordered croque monsieur's - this was simply a slice of deli ham placed on two pieces of WonderBread. We also ordered bacon that never came, we eventually just cancelled it.

"Due to  spending 14 months in Korea and COVID, I haven't eaten Mexican in a couple of years.  I was in the area, had a taste for Mexican and decided to give JoToro a try.  It turned out to be one of the worse restaurant experiences of my life.  The food was ok.  It would have been good if it was at least served hot.  What made this an awful experience was the horrendous and obvious racist service we received from my waitress.  After being seated, it took more than 20 minutes for my waitress to acknowledge my presence and take my order.  A white couple came in and was seated 10 minutes after me.  They were served and received their meal before I was even given a menu to review.  Another black couple was ignored as well who arrived after me and before the white couple.  It is was so obvious what was happening before my eyes.  When my order was finally taken and my food arrived, the waitress placed the plates on the table and pushed them across the table as if she was serving chow to her dogs.  I was so insulted by her nasty and disrespectful treatment my blood was boiling.  When it was time to pay, the waitress looked totally shocked when I didn't tip her and gave a thumbs down on their one question survey.  I'm sure she had a preconceived opinion of me because I'm black.  She would never know or believe I'm an active duty Army LTC with 26 years, deployed to Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Inherent Resolve and two tours in Korea.  My last comment is for black people.  Black people, you are not welcome here.  Go somewhere else to spend your hard earned money.",-0.8278
"I would rather not write negative reviews but this place was subpar and expensive. For vegetarian or vegan people they had a tacos but they were not good. Just put some rice and beans on a tortilla and old tasting squash. Now if it was tasty then ok, but it was bland. I had the 3 tacos and margarita for $15 but again, bland, zero flavor. Had to ask for everything, hot sauce, salt and pepper and the service wasn't good either. I always leave 20% tips but here I gave it 14% because I'm not cheap but man they need to work on the service and food.",-0.4057

They completely random out of black beans before even starting a new pot of them. Then, they completely ran out of chicken so I had to wait another 7 minutes for the chicken to cook and be cut. So 20 minutes I waited for essentially lack of preparation. Not to mention they are stingy on the rice and fajita veggies. Will not be returning to this Chipotle! Disappointed!",-0.9253
"Stayed away because of the mixed reviews but our drinks tonight were the nail in the coffin. Dropped in after a Lightning game but the drinks were undrinkable. The 1st red flag was when I ordered my drink and the bar back claimed they were out. I brushed it off as maybe they were out of the liquor required but it now makes me think the cocktails are pre-mixed garbage . I settled on the Blueberry Gin Fizz and my fiancé got a Woodford Ole Fashioned- they were the worst drinks I've had in memory and I lived in a college town for 10 years. It made the faux pas of the Ole Fashioned being in a plastic cup an afterthought. They tasted like gag worthy cough syrup and we couldn't finish either one. A waste of $25. I can only see this place staying open b/c of its location. I'll def head elsewhere in the future",-0.7469
"Made a reservation for Mother's Day hoping to find a new Mexican food gem for brunch. What a joke. Michelin star chef must've put his name on it and LEFT THE BUILDING. They opened at 11am. We arrived at 10:55am thinking they'd be packed; they weren't. Sign #1. I was happy to receive a sunflower  upon opening as a Mom. Good start. Only a few items on the brunch menu. Not nearly enough options to claim yourself as a brunch spot. My fiancée asked for scrambled eggs instead of fried with his chilaquiles and were told they cannot scramble eggs. What?! This was true and they did not pivot from this honestly unbelievable fact. THEN all 3 meals arrived as if they were plated the night before and freezing cold in some spots and room temp
In others. Pathetic and disgusting. I ordered the Mexican eggs Benedict and the eggs were barely poached and clear. Atrocious. The hollandaise was ICE COLD. We sent two of three meals back and will never return. The server was sweet but this was a total waste of money. They took the two meals off the bill but the entire thing should have been comped. Run! Run somewhere else for Mexican in Tampa! Anywhere else! We went to McDonald's drive thru after because we were starving and they got our order right and it was hot. Get a clue Jotoro!",-0.3182

I ordered 2 of the Flower Power Empamamas and discovered after staring to eat one that is was filled with meat even though it had a sticker on it stating it was the vegan flower power. I immediately went back, and the manager was somewhat apologetic, but stated it happens more than they would like. I told them this was VERY unacceptable, as if this was a food allergy issue things could have been much was worse. They gave me the correct item, and offered me some fries or a drink to compensate the ""mistake""..really?

I would have rather put a toothpick between my big toe and toenail ... then kicked a cement brick like Ronaldo. The steak was rubber. The chips reminded me of biting a grocery store brand bottle of water. There was no flavor in the salsa. This is the worst chipotle of all time. Rest In Peace to my gastrointestinal tract. Nasty nasty chipotle",-0.9169
"The service was as bad as the food!  The sour cream was curds.  The nachos were drenched in a nasty unflavored cheese sauce.  The chips at the bottom were soggy because of the sauce.  

The Flatus had fat in both of the two I tried to eat.  When we showed the server he made an excuse, ""The meat we buy has a lot of fat on it"". I'm sorry, that shouldn't be a problem your customers should have to endure.  He didn't even try to correct the problem, he slipped me the tab.  I forgot that I pre ordered Churros.

"Our weekend getaway was cancelled so we decided to try out Poblanos for a margarita and some lunch. It started with a long wait to even give our drink order. This followed by a different server bringing out our margs. But here is the kicker... He politely explained that they had no bartender and he had never made this drink before. Needless to say it wasn't the greatest but I felt sorry for him and excepted it anyway.  Our server finally took our order where we asked for two appetizers that we never received and it took well over 30 minutes to get our meal.  After a few bites of my burrito I realized Abuelas guacamole was missing. I was told it now comes on the side and was brought a tiny serving of clearly guacamole from a jar.  I asked the manager to take it away explaining the issue. The manager did not seem to be particularly concerned and believe it or not I finally had to ask for my check. I will not be returning and I suggest you skip it as well.",-0.5027

"By far the worst ""Mexican"" food we've ever eaten! The guy at the register didn't know the menu. When we ordered a carne asada chimichanga, he asked, what is that. We should've known then it was time to go. 

My hubby ordered the carne asada chimichanga and I ordered the seafood burrito with two beef empanadas. All of the food outside of the beef empanadas had absolutely zero flavor. No salt, no pepper, no nothing. Not to mention, my seafood burrito had an abundance of water spilling out of it. The meat to burrito ratio was none existent. There was barely any meat in both burritos. The guacamole is green spread. No where near what guacamole is. The salsa was too hot to even eat with no flavor. The guy cooking the food looked so sad like he didn't want to be there. 

The one star is for the beef empanadas and cleanliness of the restaurant for it to be in a gas station. We wish we would've just ordered a bag of different empanadas and nothing else to save $30+ for garbage. The dough was flakey and the filling was flavorful. However, we could tell they were frozen out of the bag and fried.

At this location, you get and XXL tortilla...half empty, half full of beans and rice with a lite dusting of meat. And I ordered WITHOUT BEANS. You don't see this many empty folds in a Taco Bell burrito. Not to mention they wrapped it in just foil and cut it thru it with what had to be a serrated knife cuz there were little bits of foil in the first couple bites. And for $15 you should be ashamed of yourselves. I don't know how the service is in the day time but do yourself a favor and steer clear of this place at night. It'll ruin your whole vibe. This is my third time getting the same treatment. Two thumbs down. Way down. Will not be back.",-0.8537

Another time I ordered online and they said the opposite. Apparently it is their policy. When I asked if I could have my quesadilla made in the machine the person gave me a dirty look and I said thank you and was polite and he did not say a word to me. Thankfully there is an easy solution for this. There is a newer Chipotle on Fowler very close to this location and it is a night and day difference. Even though I live close to this location I go out of my way to go to the other location because this place has constantly given terrible customer service.",-0.128
"Awful. The service is the slowest I've ever seen. The meat is dry and chewy. The tacos taste bland and gentrified. You're not given any sauce or toppings for tacos. You can never get anyone on the phone if there is an issue with your order. 

The last straw was getting flan with mold in it and not being able to reach anyone by phone to address the situation.",-0.4404
"Despite the recommendations it was a huge mistake going on Cinco de mayo. It really was not crowded but it was probably crowded for them. No busboys. Handcrafted margaritas weren't (said the waiter mike) yet took forever to get them and then I saw they were coming out of coolers which explains the fact they were watered down. I should have known when I got there early and asked the waiter to wipe down the sticky table and he pulled a dirty rag out of his apron and rice flew everywhere and I had to ask for a clean one. Dixie cup for my shot which for a restaurant with the large tequila menu was serving shitty tequila. No tequila menu was offered. Once again it was not as crowded as you would think of now I know why.",-0.8968
"Came through drive thru for chips and cheese and a taco. Didn't think to check the bag until I was already 15 minutes away. They gave me a bag with only a few chips in it. Maybe 5. So I called 6 times and no answer. I went back and explained to them the issue, and they were extremely rude. Said they did my order perfectly and that I was lying. So I pulled up to the window, told them I had called a ton to try and talk to them about it, I was told they never got a call. She asked if I had my receipt, which I did, so I handed it to her and she says ""no I made this order perfectly there was no way there was only a few chips. Mind you I hadn't even touched the chips and cheese, showed her my bag and she claims I was lying! So she goes to get me new ones, took a long time, and she again said I was lying and she made my order perfectly. I am a reasonable person, I don't usually go back to places If they mess up but I'm out working so I wanted to be able to have a snack with me. I called another Taco Bell about the issue, they told me to come right in and they would give me new ones, since now I don't trust the ones I was given by the rude manager. I would give this place 0 stars if I could, simply because they're rude. That is all.",-0.9533
"I ordered a 3 meat fajita mix and it was horrible . The steak didn't seem seasoned at all. The chicken was was bland and dry. The pork was also extremely dry and no flavor.

"Chipotle is my go to place for a quick meal. I always visit the location on Westshore and I've always been pleased. Today I was in the Brandon area and visit this location. I was surprised it wasn't busy as most Chipotles are, there was no line and no wait. The servers were ok and not very friendly. The cashier made up for their lack of customer service skill. I was happy to be in and out quick. However when I got home the food was disgusting. The rice was hard and the beans weren't fully cooked. The hot sauce was watered down and had no flavor. I threw it out it wasn't even eatable. I would never go back to this location again. Such a shame especially when I'm a Chipotle fan..",-0.7873
"Yuck. This is the least authentic Mexican place I've been to and I wouldn't even consider it TexMex either. We went on a Tuesday and we're excited to see it was Taco Tuesday where tacos are only $1.50+tax each. I ordered the horchata and it was watered down and gross. First disappointment. Next, our chips and salsa came. The chips were nice and thin but the salsa lacked flavor and heat (and I like very mild heat).

I ordered 2 tacos: one al pastor and one carnitas. Both were dry and lacked flavor. Taco Tuesday only applied to ground beef or chicken tacos, so I paid $2.25 each for gross tacos. My SO ordered the chimichanga and it came covered in nacho cheese sauce. The salsa verde was flavorless. 

Will never go back.",-0.3612
"This location has the worst service among the other TACO BUS in the area. I was there with my family in last Friday 09/21. I waited at this location for over 30 minutes for my order to be brought on the table but even after that the order DOES NOT came. 

So when I asked for the same, I was told that it will take some more time. This is when there is very few people at this location. I wonder how much time it will take when they have restaurant full of people.  I am NEVER EVER coming back at this location.",-0.3716
"I have been here on several occasions. Today's was by far the worst. I came with five other people who had also been here before. First, the got 4 out of the 6 orders wrong. Once that was fixed, we were stuck listening to one of the kitchen workers come outside screaming numbers right behind us. Really? There is no other way to give people their orders than screaming? Finally, one of the people we were with bit into their burrito. They bit into a bone the size of a half dollar with sharp edges. After bringing it to their attention, they told us that it was normal. How is a bone of that size NORMAL to have in your food? They offered nothing to us and continued saying that it was normal. Clearly any restaurant that says a sharp bone of that size to be in your food is one to stay away from. Needless to say, I will not be back.",-0.9288
"If you are expecting great Mexican food you will be disappointed. 

Our server casually asked if we wanted chips and guac before we were presented our menus. What they don't tell you is that this actually costs $8 and is presented with okay guac/salsa and pathetic chips. These chips are literally straight from the bag El Paso hard corn tortillas that are drowned in salt.

After suffering from the overpriced salty chips you finally get to the entree. We ordered the Lunch Tray which was a simple 3 taco and 1 side meal for $10. For the side we chose the Chopped salad which was incredible, and by incredible I mean amazingly bad. I was actually impressed that someone could make salad that bad. It tastes like it's made with a Vinegar and Lime Juice making a very bitter experience.

The Tacos were okay, not amazing or great but okay. The only downside to the tacos were how small they were. For spending $10 on 3 tacos and a salad it really was not filling. This would be great if you are looking to drink have snack foods.

Overall this was a very negative experience. I did not enjoy the food at all, having the $8 chips and dip thrown at you from the start without being presented with a menu or prices was very shady to me.",-0.8319
"The worst service of anywhere I've eaten at in a very long time.  Took 15 minutes to get coffee, after placing the order. When it arrived, there was no cream or spoon.

"I just moved here from DC and people would wait in a long that went all the way to the front door. I was happy to see their was a chipotle close by. This had to be my worst experience ever. There were only a few people in line and it took forever. They had only one guy serving, while another guy was cleaning, and the girl at the register left after each customer so u had to wait until she cam back. 

It was the smallest salad I ever gotten from chipolte, The guy barely put any salad in my bowl and the chicken was mostly dark meat with alot of fat. Onions and peppers were very soggy and looked like they been sitting there all day. My stomach did not feel good after eating this crap but I was hungry at the time. 

I am going to have to take a break from chipotle after this bad experience and try a different location in the future.",-0.8334
"I don't know where to start from customer service or the food. If you are looking to eat some greasy ass tacos this is the place.  When we got the tacos the tortillas were cold. We took them back to get warmer tacos, but the tacos are worst. They are drenched in grease! Literally the whole plate looks like a mirror you can see your reflection from all the grease it's covered in. The carne asada is not even asada, it's cooked long pieces of steamed beef. Asada is supposed to be brownish color not a pale brown. It had no taste. If it wasn't for the great salsa that comes with the chips it wouldn't taste good. Anyways we will not be coming back all the way From California.",-0.9402

I ordered a chicken taco, steak taco, and chicken burrito.  All lacked flavor and the meat was quite watery.  They also charge a la carte .30 for cheese, another .30 for sour cream.  The inside was also not in great condition.  The trash was full and several tables were dirty. Disappointing.  I won't be back.",-0.8086

When I got home I opened my box and sour cream was drizzled over the whole thing. On top of that there were hardly any mushrooms and a big junks of idk what kind of meat. And this is the second time I have gone to this location and I told them no sour cream and got sour cream, the first time I was dining in, so I only had to deal with The inconvenience of waiting for my order to be remade, instead of wasting money, having an inedible meal, and being hungry.",-0.8225

Yes- I said a penny, you know the copper coin!  Yikes!     It got worse from there...  Of course, we called our server over to the table and asked for the manager.   The server was mortified.  The manager? Less so... in fact she had the nerve to suggest we planted the penny!  Imagine our reaction?  Needless to say we refused to pay ( note we had just been served our food so it's not like we ate and ran. In fact, we left 90% of the food untouched and we are at another Mexican place just up the road as I write this.)

"We stumbled upon this place on a Saturday night looking for a place to get tacos that wasn't Taco Bell. Honestly we were doing a u-turn to go to Tijuana Flats and this place was right in front of us so we gave it a shot. The place was empty at 9pm on a Saturday night. I ordered two shrimp tacos and a small carne asada burrito. The employees were definitely feeling the chronic if you get what I am saying....the one guy could not figure out how to wrap my burrito and mashed it into a ball before another employee had to fix it. 

After watching them make our food and how the food looked we stopped through the McDonalds next door just in case, and thank god we did. Neither my husband or I could finish even one taco. The shrimp was decent, but it is hard to mess up fried shrimp. The rice in my burrito was severely under cooked and the steak was the same quality as dog food, it made steak from Taco Bell look gourmet. I ate two bites of my burrito and thew it away due to the lack of taste and what I did taste was not good. My husband was in the same boat with his steak burrito, anyways $20 worth of burrito in the trash. We ordered chips and salsa with a side of queso. They did not give us salsa, they gave us the ancho sauce from the line, and the queso was the consistency of cement, very salty. 

Needless to say we wasted $35 and had to get cheeseburgers, such a disappointment on a Saturday night when all you wanted was a taco. They did not even have ground beef to get a simple taco. With Tijuana Flats literally right across the street do not make the same mistake we did. We tried and we lost, never again.",-0.9789

Please fix this because he had nothing else that could have gotten him sick (he had a chicken taco and a fish taco) - no one else in the table had shrimp tacos so we deducted to this easily. Also, the waiter kept forgetting everyone's order. He was trying to memorize requests from a group of 8. It was frequent and inconvenient. I don't think I'll be back to eat again.",-0.7684

She was the only waitstaff working the entire place of at least 20 tables. Got up and left. It was awful and such a disappointment. As we walked out, we warned others not to go in.

"On 7/13/2013, four of us visited this location; we all got different things which were acceptable but really fast food Mexican. The real problem was that all of us each ordered salsa and chips and the chips were bendable as they were not cooked long enough. We went back to the counter and the girl on the cash register bluntly said ""We cook chips twice and day and offered NOTHING"". We left and the more i thought about it, the more it bothered me. I called and spoke to a manager who offered to mail me coupons. i got home a week later from the trip and waited a few days. Two weeks and on coupons so i called again and spoke to a male manager who promised to send them. Now its 8/13/14 and no coupons. In short, NEVER AGAIN. they obviously do not care about their customers or keeping their word. Oh, by the way don't bother looking for a corporate number, it's not available.",-0.7396

My chip bag had maybe 20 chips in it, my guac container was half full and my burrito bowl was the skimpiest bowl I ever saw.

"Looked forward to my first visit with my two boys for lunch on Friday, July 1, 2016. Placed our order at the front counter and then given a reservation type buzzer/beeper that lights up when order is ready for pickup at the kitchen window.  Beeper went off and headed to kitchen window. Handed in beeper to one of the cooks and given tray with our order. Back at our table, one of my boys noticed his burrito was not there. OK mistakes happen. Took tray and receipt back to kitchen window. Said, ""hey, we're missing a burrito."" The two cooks behind the counter weren't sure if the burrito at the counter was ours, so they discussed it among themselves and finally gave the burrito to us. As we sat back down at the table a gentleman from the establishment followed us to the table. I asked if he was a manager and he said, no he was the owner. I thought good, and told the owner it was our first time there, and it was disappointing that we weren't given all of our order when we turned in the beeper to the kitchen. The owner then said ""the onus is on the customer"" to make sure they get what they ordered. Are you kidding me!  The owner took no responsibility that we were not given our entire order when we turned the beeper into the kitchen. A simple apology would have went a long way. The owner also said he'd be back to check on us. The food was really good, however the owner never came back to check on us. And we will not be back.",-0.5325

When they made my burrito in front of me the guy didn't listen and gave me white rice instead of brown, he expected me to take it that way. I said no I don't want white, I ordered brown. He had to start over. Then when he did give me the right kind he gave me a baby scoop. I had to ask for more. Then when I got to check out they forgot to ring up everything together. So I had two separate transactions. U asked the girl for limes and they were old as dirt. Just dry and bad. So I asked for fresh limes, she proceeded to go whisper in her coworkers ears probably something negative about me because I asked for fresh limes. Then when I did get the limes they were still old. They need fresher produce. The staff was a little rude and my order wasn't ready and I just sucked. I understand it was busy but that's no excuse.",-0.5107

In my first visit, customer service was not only poor at the registers, where I was given rude attitude, but throughout the restaurant where I was ignored or not helped. However, the food was just as wonderful and so this wasn't enough to stop me from going back.
My second visit was worse. The person at the register was again unfriendly, lacking in energy, rushing and the worst part, was not even acknowledging my husband standing right next to me. This person didn't bother to greet him, or ask if he would like to order anything. Another issue I had during this visit was a worker was cleaning the table next to ours and accidentally knocked a  jar of sauce off the table. Glass and hot sauce was everywhere! No one bothered to clean this hazard up, and not even a wet floor sign was put in front of it!

This particular location is horribly unorganized and terribly managed. I put an online order today for pick up at 4:15PM. 

I arrived at 4:20 PM and saw on the door that they were out of guac. I waited about 5 minutes to pay, they tried to charge me for the guac. I pointed this out and the cashier ""fixed"" it. When I looked at my receipt they had still charged it on one of my two orders. I waited another 5 minutes for this to be refunded. 

I had to remind them at 4:35 that I was still waiting because they were not even working on my order yet. I had placed this order at 3:00 PM. 

I finally got my food at 4:45 and I'm not sure if the orders are even correct since I no longer have time to eat. This took up my entire 1 hour lunch. 

All this on top of how the entire staff looks dirty, lazy, and unorganized. They definitely didn't care.

We ordered and waited for our food only for mine to come out wrong. I mentioned this to the waitress. No offer to correct it. She got me a box. I ate some of my rice and tried the beans but both tasted off. I tried half of a quesadilla from my friend's lunch, but it did not taste fresh at all. 
Within an hour of leaving, both of her children were sick and we weren't feeling well ourselves. I tried calling to speak to an owner or manager but the waitress remembered us and kept giving me the runaround. I left my name and number, knowing that I would probably not hear back. After speaking to several other people, this is apparently an all too common experience at this establishment. I may have given them a second chance if the kids (and us!) hadn't gotten sick.",-0.8837
"You could not pay me to go back to this place.  I usually don't bother with negative reviews - I don't like to point out ugly.  However, after waiting for 45 minutes to be seated then not getting all of our meal served over the span of 2 hours after repeatedly reminding the waitress what was not served, repeatedly asking for water (ice or no ice - of course, they were out of ice), and being eaten up by mosquito bites (bring spray), I cannot earnestly recommend this place - even though the General Manager was kind and offered apologies and comp'd the meal for our family.  We ended up going to Tijuana Flats to meet our hunger needs on the way home.",-0.2477

He then ask if i want another soda i say yes he brings me a to go cup.   I say are u kidding. I'm in the middle of my meal.  Then he brings me the check. I finally say. Dude. Do u have some place u have to be that u have to ruin my meal.   Not happy",-0.0636
"1 star is a stretch. The food was edible and thats about it. We went here tonight after not coming here for almost 2 years because we didn't feel like driving to Brandon and going to sabor a Mexico, (we should have made the drive). No surprise... Nothing has changed and the food is still overpriced and not good. I orders the carnitas (after a recommendation from my server) and they were SOOOO dry and chunked pieces not pulled. My husband and MIL both were disappointed with their dinners too and even expressed their dislike to the server who blamed us for not telling him exactly what we wanted. Needless to say this is our last and final attempt to find a New Mexican restaurant in the Riverview area. We will not be back.",-0.9262

"After all that's going on with chipotle this location isn't helping their reputation. We arrived to this location on time of opening only to wait another 5-10 mins for them to actually open the doors. We asked for rice which no matter if you went brown or white it was very undercooked and crunchy. We asked for chicken which they made us get extra when they gave us what looked like left overs from the day before. Only to eat that and realize it was reheated, extremely burnt, and extra salty. The guacamole was so brown... You could a 100% tell this wasn't made fresh. For a company under so much scrutiny right now... You would think the locations would try much harder on keeping their food at high standards. After reading the other reviews this isn't the first time they have had food issues. The manager at this location really needs to re-evaluate their service, quality, and employees here. I would recommend stopping at another location before eating here!",-0.2124

"This is perhaps the worst food I have ever ingested. Number one I ordered a Carne Asada burrito preñado with no beans and extra rice instead of beans. After 10 minutes my burrito came with beans. Fine, anyone can make a mistake.... As soon as the cashier requested a burrito with no beans I got the nastiest look from the line cook, At that point I felt like walking away due to the ""special ingredient"" I was about to get. Burrito arrives with no extra rice and three pounds of COLD Mexican cheese. Took my first bite and DEAR LORD I felt like I was eating a HUMAN from an airplane accident. Meat was veiny, hard, and tasted like old jerk meat. Even tho I asked if the burrito came with some vegetables and got a yes for an answer, I found at the most to  4 kernels of corn and an untraceable amount of bagged lettuce. Not the type of guy that whines about his food but when they reach my OH NO box I gotta say something. AVOID THIS HORRIBLE PLACE!!!!",-0.9607

"Had heard some good things about this place.  Didn't get a chance to even really try the food because the service was so bad.  

The waiter was extremely rude.  We thought he was just busy but by the time we left it almost seemed personal!  We asked for waters with our margaritas several times and he never brought them out.  We had to ask the busboy to bring waters.  We wanted to have dinner but we couldnt get the waiter to come back to the table so we ordered some con queso from the busboy.  Our waiter brought out the con queso, but with no chips.  By this point we just got the bill and left, after tipping the busboy.  

Terrible place.  Will not go back.  So many other great Mexican places to go.  Go to Miguels or even Taco Bus if your looking for Mexican food.",-0.5436
"I know. Why are you reviewing taco bell? It'd taco bell. It sucks 100% of the time whether or not the service is amazing, because it's taco bell. It's fast food. Blah blah. You're wrong. Taco Bell is Taco freaking Bell! It's the place to go if you have a few bucks and don't feel like cooking. I can feed a family of four with like $17. That's amazing. Until today.

Let me paint this picture: I just got back from Adventure Island and the kid was hungry. I saved enough calories for the day for two chicken soft tacos and a black bean burrito. YES! This is my go to meal for when I want to feel like I'm actually getting something good (GORDITA) (nachos) (Mexican Pizza) but I can't eat like I used to because this middle aged body isn't allowing such shenanigans. So we get to the window. I tell my boyfriend that the person is probably one of the most pleasant voices I've heard in Florida. People aren't as hospitable here as they are back home, but that is what it is I guess.

We get to the window, this chick snatches the debit card from my boyfriend, and slings it back. Hey Florida Taco Bell, did you know that in Tucson they brought back DIABLO sauce? And we also have Verde? Imagine my disdain when she barked that those aren't available. I was kind of sad, but whatever. We got our overly stuffed bag and drove off. I tried to check it, but it was SO CRAMPED. 

So we get here to the house, and you already know the drill. We are missing two menu items. Bah! I am already out of my wet swimsuit. My boyfriend who loves to completely avoid confrontation senses my irritation and drives all the way back to retrieve the missing food, even though if it were his way he would have just shared part of his gorditas or whatever. One star for being all snatchy and grabby, having attitude, not having verde or diablo (totes just called a gf of mine who is a boss at a taco bell back home, they STILL have them) and for forgetting our food, and getting stuff wrong. Of course I'm going back. It's Taco Bell ffs.",-0.9747

So buy a bottle of opus one that they have on their menu and you get to drink it in an airplane size glass that's poured almost to the top. Awesome. Way to waste my freaking money and ruin my wine. I switched to a martini after they proved to not be trustworthy with wine, and I had large pieces of ice that I had to chew with every sip. I sent it back. The waitress said their strainers suck. Well then get new ones?! Really?? Just continue to serve crap drinks rather than doing things the way they should be done?? And they serve water in plastic cups. Are you kidding me?! How cheap can you get.

The menu was very dirty and had dried on residue on it, the salt and black pepper container were dirty and definitely needed to wipe down. The service was awful she kept me waiting for about 10 minutes just to get some lime.

Two minutes later two girls sat down next to me and they seemed to know the bartender, he asked what they wanted and then instead of making my margarita... he made theirs first and made sure their area was cleaned down, they had menus and utensils, as I just waited there starring at him. The whole time I thought he was making mine.... nope. I had to wait another 15 minutes for him to realize ""oh yea"". Never wiped down the counter, it was all food and sticky from other peoples drink. I had to ask the people on the other side for a menu....

Also the meat was slimy and the chips not cooked and straight out of the box which they came from. Can I give zero stars? I will never go back because for poor service and nasty food.",-0.9688

I called them immediately after I already ate a full taco and was in the middle of the second one. When I called they said that there is no way the meat is raw because it is cooked well done. They also said that what I was seeing was not raw meat but it was salsa. I expressed my dissatisfaction and they said I can call back after 5pm to talk to the manager.

"First, I was skeptical due to the reviews on here, but i really wanted mexican. I was also very shocked at the price, for just a chicken fajita, pick up order. I shrugged it off thinking it would be a large amount of food. I got there and waited at the bar to pick up my order, for 8 Minutes with my food in front of me ready to go, watching it get cold as the waitresses all passed by me acting like I was not there. I get back home, open the bag, and there were no tortilla's, what kind of chicken fajita comes with no tortilla's. I noticed the amount of food was very small. I asked for extra salsa, and they gave me chips and salsa, an additional $4. The chips tasted like they were at least a day old. I will NEVER be giving this place another dime. I will continue and drive 40 minutes south for real Mexican at Mi Pueblo's in Sarasota.

There is a reason they don't list pricing online, my total bill for a chicken fajita, and chips and salsa...when i only wanted salsa, was about $20.",-0.3492

"Taco Bus used to be a phenomenal place, but expansion and publicity has done something - and it isn't good. The quality of the food has gone way done, the prices have gone way up and the service (which wasn't all that good to begin with) has dropped to an even lower level. Some people embrace being on TV, others try to monetize it- and it's too bad that this place has taken the latter.

Hopefully the owner will return to his roots, because the original Taco Bus on Hillsborough used to be worth a 30 minute drive. Now, none of them are worth going to.",-0.1576

"My husband and I visited this location on Saturday during riverfest and had the absolute worst service! Obviously it was busy when we got there, there were multiple events going on downtown, we ordered our food (both vegetarian items) and after waiting an hour I went up to the counter to see how much longer since I could see people receiving their food who ordered after us.  I was told there were six tickets ahead of ours and actually witnessed them putting tickets for new orders in front of ours!  When I asked how that could be since I saw others getting their food who ordered after us there was no answer.  We ended up just getting our money back and going somewhere else.  If you're going to have a location downtown you should schedule accordingly and have enough staff on when there are events going on and if you offer vegetarian items your staff should be willing to make them because it definitely felt as though they kept skipping our ticket because the food wasn't prepped and they didn't want to deal with it.   I will not be returning to this location.",-0.6604

The 'dip' part was a small portion of chopped squash and tomatoes, and only a few ounces of it. See the pic. Felt ripped. Needs less chips and more dip. Didn't even taste great.

After I contacted the store, driver did come back with the items I paid for an hour later but but not brings utensils or serving utensils. The store manager then refuse to credit me the gratuity that was prepaid for the crappy service. So I was stuck with a $45 gratuity for a delivery that was late and incomplete.

"We were so excited to have a Vallartas open up in Brandon. Our family has been going to the Wesley Chapel location for a long time. After several visits, we will not be back. The servers (one in particular) are rude and largely ignore their customers even when the restaurant is empty. The last few vistis (we go monthly) there has been a gross dirty mop water smell all the time. Last week they served my daughter completely RAW chicken tenders -- then I had to argue with them to get them to take it off the menu since they brought her a (one, uno) soft taco in place of those.

Health Inspection
Vallarta Restaurante Mexicano, 716 W. Lumsden Road
*Initial inspection date - May 23
*High priority violations - 9
*Intermediate violations - 8
*Basic violations - 21
Dirty conditions, improper food storage temperatures and a mold-like substance in the ice machine all raised red flags with the inspector, the state's report noted. Live, flying insects in the service station and the discovery of live roaches also rang alarm bells. The inspector noted finding 10 live roaches on a door inside the kitchen, eight on a shelf bracket above ""exposed tacos and exposed shells,"" two in a rice bin without rice in it and more in other locations. The eatery was allowed to reopen after a May 24 follow-up inspection, but the state noted a need for another visit.

We order food with vegetarian option (No Meat). Out of three, one order came with many chunks of meats. We informed the staff, they replace order and did other formalities. We did take away that replaced plate. Every thing solve.

Now, when we opened that plate at home and we found same chunk of meat. How it is even possible? 

I have called manager right away to filed complaint about this repatative mistake. As usual, they offer another plate if we visit the store again and apologized for the mistake of food containment. Also did informed me that manager on duty had not checked food for possible containment of food products after I informed them while dine in.

We got lot of apologies so far other than the food we ordered. Again, how it is even possible same mistake again???

The kitchen line was also completely disorganized, and it took asking 3 different people for one of them to finally check on our order after 45 minutes. Meanwhile, people who ordered after us were receiving their food before us. This service was completely unacceptable and a horrible experience. I can only hope this is not how their service is normally run.",-0.7369
"This is a horribly ran Chipotle. The burrito preparer was not familiar with the menu. They were out of fajita veggies for my vegetarian burrito and said they would put on the tofu instead and then charged me for the guacamole after they said they wouldn't. The rest rooms were dirty, there was a hairball on the floor and there were boxes blowing around the parking lot. Skip this chipotle at all costs.",-0.7964
"Out of lettuce out of carnitas 35 minutes before closing. Simpering server rolled her eyes and asked the cook who was cleaning an obviously powered down grill how long it would take. Blatant passive aggressive for a fast food server and cook who don't know their place...ye/ I said it, we all paid our dues. I am sick of businesses promising a available time planing my day and getting unreliable service. Chipotle is no mom and pop, there is no wiggle room when they tap tap that extra bit of meet off the tongs so corporate makes their margin so uh pony up jerk make ur promised hours.  
Your cut off. No more from me and i was a fan tried to talk others into your food, now I will sing the song of bad chain with bad service.",-0.9136

"Was excited to try this location as I have been to 2 other locations. Upon walking in you are greeted with an awkward odor that lingers the whole time. Took the server quite a while to come take our drink order, little did I know this would be the first of many unpleasant encounters we would have with her. When we got our chips and salsa it consisted of mostly old, oily, broken chips. Our dinner arrives and my dinner was incorrect and we still had no utensils. I had to ask for the menu to explain what I was missing from my order. The food was a lot to be desired, did not have much flavor. We did not see our waitress until she delivered the check so that makes a total of 5 times throughout our dining experience. They were not busy and other waitresses were tending to their tables but not ours. Definitely will not be going back to this location. In the Brandon area you get better service and food at Tres Amigos, a step above this place would be Taco Bell.",-0.2112
"This is taking soooooo long. The prices here are extremely high compared to the quality. I've waited (so far) 30 minutes for two burritos and the folks working here seem to not care less about the line. The interior itself is filthy. I would absolutely not come here again. Not worth it.",-0.5096
"This place gave me everything wrong. I asked for two Doritos tacos and only received one. I asked for hot and fire sauce and received none. I got a quesadilla and it was missing an ingredient. My fiesta potatoes had one drop of cheese on them. Never going back the one on 60 never messes up my order.",-0.6908

"If you love getting riped off, go to, the worst ""Mexican""  resturant in Tampa, Taco Bus. The service was horrible, as well as The food! I wasted $52 on the worst food I've ever tasted, my husband , nephew and 2 children, and I didn't order a meal for my kids, we decided to share. We order a quesadilla (grilled) which was horrible it had pollo Verde decebrado inside, the chcken was dry and it has big chunks of it and the cheese simply, no! The burrito, we ordered it with chuxken, it was a ""burrito"" with no rice or beans inside just chicken and lettuce and onions I believe,but thank god it didn't have any beans in it the beans are not a pleasant taste at all. The rice was eehh. We also orders a torta with carnitas, I don't know what that was but it definitely didn't taste like carnitas! We also ordered two tacos of carnitas, same, they didn't bother to take The excess water off the carnitas, so the tacos were so soggy. Also the dip and chips, we got queso as the dip, it was white cheese, it wasn't the worst thing I ordered but also not the best. The chips were cold and hard. The drinks, we got horchata, they don't make it and its not good. 

Now the service is probably as bad as the food. When you place your order the cashier yells out what to order to the kitchen that is maybe like 3 steps away from her. She would yell every time I would add something. 

Overall it was the worst place I went to on my visit to Tampa!! I would give this place zero stars if I could but unfortunately I have to give them one!!!",-0.9895

"I've eaten at the taco bus for many years, starting at the original one on Hillsborough Ave. Went again last night to the one downtown . The food used to be fresh, tasty food, but since the business expanded and added location both the service and quality of food have suffered. 
The quality of food has been steadily deteriorating. The rice was old, the refried beans had clumped. Both beans and rice were cold. The fish tasted very funky fishy and was undercooked. No ice in the coke machine. And employees mixed up orders.
Management took no responsibility when they put sour cream on the fish taco instead of my friend's beef tacos! As specified on receipt. And had the audacity to claim it's tartar sauce (as if we don't know the difference between the two). Plus we didn't ask for tartar sauce.
The quality of food at the Hillsborough location has greatly declined as well.",-0.7837
"I came here to get a burrito.  First time visit.  It was really not a great experience.  Food was luke-warm with no freshness at all.  The beans in the burrito were more like a bean paste.  The service was nothing exceptional... Or even good.  The atmosphere...  They have wrestling masks hanging on the wall.  Why?  Senseless decor.",-0.0205
"I ordered the two tacos 1)pollo chipotle and 2)butternut squash. I didn't feel like writing reviews this weekend, but the food was so bad I needed to warn others. The squash didn't taste bad, but it wasn't good either. The chicken was so poorly cooked and prepared, I didn't eat it. The rice on the side tasted like bland rice but was edible. The beans tasted like baby food, no substance. There coke machine was out of coke and root beer, when I mentioned it to the girl behind the counter she politely said she couldn't figure out how to change it. Really poor leadership here, I won't ever be back.",-0.9836
"Arrived with our pet and asked to be seated outside which they directed us to enter thru a gate on the outside perimeter. As we were seated we were directed to the rear of the patio passing an empty table near the entrance. Waited and waited for anyone to acknowledge our arrival only to have someone seated at the table to our left rear and the a couple was seated in the aforementioned table near the entrance. Well we continued to be ignored so as I looked over at the table near the entrance the newly seated couple had received their chips and salsa so I proceeded to go up to the hostess desk to ask why we were being bypassed and ignored. Returned to my table and continued to wait only to observe that the previously mentioned table near the entrance was placing their order while I continued to wait. So I made another trip to the hostess stand to ask again if I could get a wait person. 
 Finally someone came and took our order. Ordered a beer and they brought me 2 which I gave one to my wife and started drinking the other. I finished the first one and since my wife doesn't really care for beer I started drinking the other one. Lot an behold the couple at the table near the entrance and they were receiving their food. Mind you now I haven't seen our waitress again so another waiter happened to go by so I asked for the manager and several minutes later he showed up and said he would check on my order. Now the couple at the table near the entrance was asking for their check as they were finished eating. 
 Food arrived via the Mgr. and as with almost all of my experiences of eating at a Mexican restaurant I wasn't asked to watch out for the hot plates since these had obviously been sitting waiting for awhile. By the way the table to my left rear was having the exact same problem and the table near the entrance was finished and had left the premises. 
  Needles to say never again will I darken these doors. Wasn't offered an apology or anything. I tipped the waitress (Why I don't know) but I also told her to her face that she did' deserve it.",-0.6119
"If I could give this location half a star, I would. Where do I start? Ok first, aside from the school bus facade out front, (which was the only thing cool about this place) the interior of the shop was bland and dreary. 

Second, the cashier was extremely rude. Very short with us taking our order and when she figured that I took too long taking my credit card back from her, as I looked down she gave me a 'would you hurry up' face and shook my card at me, my partner told me later. Okkkk. That's not nice.

Thirdly and most importantly was the food which is why we came in the first place-the tacos. The tacos were small and disappointing. No flavor. None. I had the Two Taco Platter-a Carne Asada Taco and a Shrimp Taco. You are also just given the two tacos-no chips, no rice n beans, nothing. 

Coming from the Imperial Valley in Southern California where Mexican food, particularly carne asada is a way of life, this was easily the worst I'd ever had in my life. Absolutely flavorless. They should be ashamed to call that crap carne asada. The shrimp taco was better-edible. Not hard. Frozen shrimp, cabbage, a dab of salsa. Done.

My partner had the ground beef nachos which also sucked. I mean, how do you mess up nachos?? The meat was also flavorless. Just a mass of meat. Plus, the nachos had carrots in it. In what world does anyone put carrots on nachos? I thought ok, let's try it. Nothing.They added nothing to the dish!
 
No salsa or sauce was provided nor were we given any by the other food server in the place there who plopped our food down on a filthy tray, btw. I couldn't believe that she just put our food down on an absolutely filthy tray with food all over it and slid it over to me! 

Horrific service and bland, tasteless food. I am terribly disappointed with Taco Bus. We traveled from Fort Lauderdale and TB was number one on my list of places that we missed last visit to St. Pete. No bueno.",-0.9879
"I had the most unprofessional and terrible experience working with this restaurant to set up a private event. We were planning to host an author reading there to coincide with the AWP conference that was happening that second weekend of March. We had reserved the room, and everything was going well so far, until just a few days before the scheduled event. I received an email from the coordinator I'd been working with, who told me that they could no longer host us unless we spent a minimum of $2000. This was never made clear to us in the months prior to planning. As a small nonprofit organization, this amount was out of reach for us. We had agreed on a set menu and drink tickets and I let them know that we needed to stay within a $500 budget. We had advertised the event on multiple social media channels and already promised our authors that the event would be happening. All of the logistics were in place. Needless to say we were completely blindsided. I also happened to be on vacation when this email came through-- lucky I happened to check it and forward it to my boss. When my boss got in touch with her, she said, ""Oh we were trying to reach Greta."" My Out of Office reply stated specifically to be in touch with my boss while I was out! They offered to move the event to a different location that was a 10 minute drive away from the conference site, and assured us that all of the food items we had ordered would be transferred over there and that the manager of the new place would be handling everything. This was not ideal, as we'd picked the original location because it was within walking distance from the conference, but we felt we had no choice on such last minute notice. 

Fast forward to the actual event. They were completely unprepared. No food, no proper lighting, no mic and stand for our authors. It was as if they didn't care about us at all and had no desire to work with us. Just completely unprofessional. Our on site staff ended up cancelling the event on the spot and apologizing to our authors. 

Overall it was just a terrible experience. They were obviously more concerned about making a profit off of the conference attendees than caring about trying to work with us to make our event special. In the entire history of us setting up private events during this conference, we have never had such an experience with a restaurant, and it was just unfortunate that it had to happen this year. I have never been to Tampa, but if I ever go I will plan to steer clear of this place and will never give them any of my business!!",-0.9707
"This store, no -- Taco Bell as a whole, could take lessons from Chick-fil-A. There is just a culture of placing this and lack of care and excellence and what they do.  Every time we come to the store and go through the drive-through there's always something wrong with our order. I can't count how many times I've had to call back and complain, tried to do that tonight but they did not answer the phone after we tried several times in a 10 minute period.

Both hard taco shells in our taco Supremes were stale to the point where they would bend before you could break them. Hardly any sour cream, and the little containers they gave us for the cheese for our side nachos had hardly any cheese in both of them.",-0.25

"I came Bartaco for the first time tonight. We called ahead for our party and waited an hour to sit. I was at the bar before and was told they would transfer my tab no problem to my table. Once we finally sat the service was horrible and slow, the server checked on us maybe twice the whole time. I also told the server multiple times about my bar tab transfer which never happened. At the end he made us feel stupid about wanting separate checks (which we said from the beginning) and it took forever. At which point still didn't get my bar transfer, and I was chased for and made to feel stupid yet again  like it was my fault the server didn't do his job. I had to go to the now crowded bar and fix this myself after being there 2+ hours unnecessarily. Overall the experience was horrible via their whole system and the server, and this review is coming from a server. And on top of it all, the tacos weren't good.",-0.9502

My son is not 21 so I asked the bartender if we could sit at high top table in bar area, he said yes but then reprimanded the waiter for taking our order. My husband spoke with hostess, and she said it was fine for us to eat there. We ordered dinner. My husband ordered another bottled beer and wine for me as our dinner had not yet arrived. He took a sip of his beer - looked at me, said it tasted like water. I sipped it - yes, dirty water. I poured some from the bottle into an empty wine glass. Water, dirty water.

Dinner arrived without the meat for the fajitas. We waited for the server to return with the chicken. My husband told the waiter, showed him the water that was coming out of the bottle. He was disgusted also. 

The waiter returned after speaking with the bartender, who was laughing. We turned down the offer of a new bottle of beer- paid and left. Drinking dirty dishwater ruined our appetite. Will never return to this establishment.",-0.8381

After waiting for 20 minutes for to-go ""nachos"" and receiving the wrong order TWICE, I can say that at least the quality of the service matches that of the food.

"Upon numerous visits to TAPS I was always confused about a few things. It's location, decor, and exactly who they think there customer base is. TAPS is relying on the downtown condo boom that is never going to happen. 

Upon entering the decor is fancy, expensive, but, lacks any style, thought or practicality for what is an upscale beer and wine bar. You'll be eating that food and drinking that beer surrounded by an odd mash-up of decor. One wall is painted white and sectioned by profuse molding and mounted sconces like a scene from Martha Stewart Living. Another is lined by high-top, leather booths backed by dark gray slate. Really just very odd to spend all of that money and have it look so confused. 

Now for the food and service. Most everything is overpriced due to the rent of the location I am sure and the food with the exception of the sliders, and macaroni and cheese is somewhat bland. Especially for 12-15 per plate appetizers. For example, the bruschetta is drenched in oil , raw tuna is doused in sauce covering the real flavor. Which is kind of how the food goes at TAPS. Sandwiches are fine, as well as sliders which are hard to mess up. The beer list is impressive, 30 drafts upwards of 70 bottles, however, it is par for the course for any current beer bar, and World of Beer makes their selection laughable and are better priced. 

Finally the service is the kind where you are made to feel like you should be thanking them for being there and not the other way around. Unfriendly, non-talkative bartenders, incompetent waitresses, and just an overall pretentiousness that you can sense in the air. I do not recommend TAPS because they do not appreciate your business, and really the food, service, or beer is not good enough for a return visit. Remember this is the service industry and the service is poor at TAPS. I think they will be closed in two years. Go to The Fly right around the corner to see how things should be.",-0.8888
"Stopped in after leaving the library for a quick snack. It was about 1 pm on a sunday, so it was very slow. It took a rather long time to be greeted, then the server stood for about 5 mins having a conversation instead of bringing our drinks. 

We were the first table away from the bar so we were with in eye sight of the server. He never passed back by and the other server past our table 4 times with out stopping as we sat with empty cups.  We waited so long I had to actually get up and walk over to the bar I order to get a refill. The server seemed to caught up in chatting with a female customer as a pose to serving my wife and I.

My wife and I went in on a Thursday night and there was absolutely no one there. We sat at the bar and waited at least fifteen minutes before we were asked if we wanted a drink, mind you at least five employees walked by us. After they realized that we were actually there to spend money they offered a drink. We ordered shortly after that, the food came I had fajitas my wife had the seafood enchiladas, the fajitas were eatable however the enchiladas were awful no flavor and tasted like the sauce was ten days old. The chips had so much salt on them you would be bloated for days. The other four people in the bar were locals and all complained about the rude owner. Long and short of it this place is awful, the food is worse than awful and the service is worse the both. Don't waste your time or money.",-0.9225

"mismanagement of this store show when it's 11:30 and I've been waiting 25mins and still didn't make it place my order, why? People were order 2-5 orders... That is just ridiculous...should have them separate for the actual people who made the effort to go and get their food. To top it off the exit door was still locked.. So a line out the door and now you have to walk thru everyone to get our utter ridiculous!",-0.2481
"Where are the half stars? One star is being generous.  Went to Mi Casa Mexican Restaurant a few months back but wasnt impressed. Decided to give them another try with wifey since we were in the area, BIG MISTAKE!  Food was bland like before with no taste at all.  The freshly made guacamole wasnt fresh at all,  no taste , not made with salt or lime. It was an ice cream, pureed scoop on top of lettuce, tomato and onion.  I can definetly tell you it was bought somewhere in bulk,  already made.  My GUAC is 100x better and im not in the restaurant business. Dont advertise fresh if it isnt.  Its soooo... obvious when  the food comes out in like 3 minutes. There faster than Taco Bell. Should take time in quality and preparing food, this isnt fast food.  Its makes me mad that Mi Casa pulled a fast one on me and robbed me of $40.  Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me.  Last time im going there.",-0.975
"The food is fine but over priced... however, that isn't the part about bartaco that is frustrating - it is the service. Before you get into the restaurant, your table is given away to someone else. Then you finally get in after an additional wait and the food takes forever, your drinks run dry, and it takes forever to pay. Spend your money somewhere else.",-0.6187
"Worst experience ever,My meat was half cooked it was basically still raw. Employees weren't focus on their work duties they were more entertained on fooling around with each other and talking on their phone. And worst 30 bucks I ever spend.",-0.847
"This restaurant is not a good choice for anyone wanting a good atmosphere and hot food. The service is pushy towards the customer. I did not feel comfortable telling the server or manager my food was cold the cheese in my enchiladas was not melted at all two different nights I ate there. The last straw was when I ordered enchiladas and they had the wrong sauce on them when I mentioned this to the server and manager I was offered a small cup on the side of the right sauce. I also found meat on my plate there was no reason to have meat on my plate, I am a vegetarian I found the mistakes in my dining to be unacceptable. I don't drink and I don't eat steak so I can't find any reason to eat there because the Mexican part of the restaurant is very poor.",-0.9675
"Ordered for delivery through door dash and received plastic in my burrito and which was supposed to be steak and got ground beef which they claim its steak but if the meat is right then their quality meat completely sucks. I do not recommend this place at all! Save yourself the headache and google other Mexican taquerias instead. 100% unsatisfied and will never order from here again. The lady over the phone sounded very nice and said she made to check the order before it was delivered and obviously she was lying. .5 star of a restaurant for sure",-0.5279
"Love Taco Bus, but this location is the worst. Tried it again yesterday for the last time. Waited 40 minutes for stone cold meals and stale, old corn tortillas. Forgot our side too.

"First time here and the girl at the counter was extremely rude. We walked in and waited far from the counter so we could get a chance to look at the menu. She was impatient, impolite, and unprofessional. She kept asking what we wanted when we said we weren't ready to order. We had not even gotten a minute to read the menu and she was speaking to us like she didn't want us there. Not sure if she's racist or we just caught her on a bad day but tapping your pen and giving customers an attitude especially when they have not done ANYTHING wrong is flat out rude. AND THEY GOT MY ORDER WRONG WHEN IT CAME OUT. Fuck this place and that girl. Save your money and your blood pressure.",-0.9505

"I have never liked this Taco Bell, but I had a craving for something crunchy tonight...so I pull up and the drive-thru is wrapped around with an empty parking lot. I park and go inside in hopes to get my food quicker. I'm standing in the lobby with two employees, when one goes behind the register, and takes the other employees order! Not only does this girl not know what she wants, fumbles with change, and spent an entire 5 minutes ordering, but she then proceeds to try and have a conversation with her co-worker who just took her order immediately after! Didn't move to the side, and didn't wait for me to order (which should have happened first anyway). The girl working behind the counter finally says, ""let me take her real quick"" UH, NO DUH! 
I then wait and watch every single car go through the drive-thru until it is clear and then some before I finally get my burrito. NEVER AGAIN. I should have walked out as soon as I was put second in ordering. Worst service I've experienced.
And the burrito... Not heated throughout, mushy, disappointing, and a waste of money. DO NOT GO HERE",-0.9436
"This restaurant is so disappointing, the food is cold, the cheese enchiladas, the cheese is not melted they often bring the wrong sauce on the orders. The owner is a domineering and orders the customers to complain more than once to get the order right or he won't take it off the check even when I told him and the server my order was wrong and cold. Don't waste your time or money here if your going for a good time and satisfying meal. Never again.",-0.6792

"My family and I have been going there for over a year and never had issues  until last night despite their extremely slow service. We decided to go there to celebrate our New Years and had ordered to go since we wouldn't have arrived until half an hour before closing.

Aside from keeping us waiting for an additional 20 minutes for our food, they even charged us double for one of the items. When questioned they were dismissive and said they would take care of it. We went home and saw the additional item in the bag and saw I was still charged for it despite polietely asking them to make the corrections. We called them to rectify the situation the manager was rude started yelling, further more started pretending to not speak English midsentence and hung up the phone.
We drove back and returned every single Item  untouched yet again no refund but have the manger and staff laugh instead. They just lost their long term clients with their cheap tactics, rude and inappropriate behavior. Do not recomend this place to anyone!",-0.2853
"Stopped in last week and ordered two butternut squash tacos with extra guacamole. I specifically asked if they came with a sour cream as I cannot have it and was assured by the young lady taking the order that they don't. Sure enough my order arrived with a sour cream on the tacos. No problem, mistakes are made. I nicely informed the server that brought them to me and she promptly removed them from the table and told me shed get it taken care of. My plate arrived back two minutes later with finger prints throughout the guacamole and bits of sour cream smeared into the squash and throughout the taco. I couldn't believe it and refused to send my food back a second time. I have always been a fan of taco bus but this experience has made me question their quality of service and I am very disappointed.",-0.7069
"This place was disgusting, ghetto and just plain nasty. There was some chick who closely resembled Jabba the hut ordering people around. I ordered a taco for my niece they put all the ingredients in separate little containers instead of making the taco like they do in other locations. The black beans were still hard and had no sauce. I asked for a little onions and peppers on my bowl and Jabba screamed at the worker to add more. Let's talk about the pushy patrons who felt the need to push their way into your personal space. The real kicker to this horrible experience is the fact that as I am writing this I have been throwing up violently and other food poisoning related issues since I ate the food from this disgusting joint.",-0.9791
"Ok this is my last trip to the Westshore location...  I'm just going to Hyde park from now on.  I have a question.  Do you have a manager working here?

Every time I'm here it's the dirtiest Chipotle that I've ever been in.  The cashier left to go look for something in the store room, no ice (15 minutes), out of tops... Genuinely a crappy attitude from the staff!  This place needs a manager or closed!",-0.8217
"If could give it a negative - 3 I would . By far the worst food I've ever had so salty. Order a few margaritas took 30 mins to get each  . Because the bartender was so busy talking to a guy customer. That it took 30 mins each time and she was acting like she was doing us a favor. Overall I would NOT RECOMMEND this place at all .",-0.7393
"We were immediately seated when we went in. We were promptly brought soft tortilla shells with two kinds of salsa as well as sweet butter. The waiter was nice, but did not do a good job! The place was by no means full and the service was so, so terrible. I ordered a beer and my friend ordered a margarita right as we sat down. The waiter brought them to us promptly, and basically he never came back til after we were finished. The food is brought out by a runner. By the time we got the food, my beer was almost gone. We flagged the waiter down and asked for another round of drinks and my friend asked if she could have a water. He said he would bring it right away, but he never did. At this point, we were frustrated and almost finished with our food. He came back a second later and said ""Would you like a water?"" And she said ""Yeah I asked you last time you were here."" Anyway, long story short, he never brought the beer to me and I was finished with my food. I went my whole meal without any kind of drink, and my friend's margarita came after she finished her food. So we basically had to sit there until she finished the margarita that she originally wanted to have with her meal. He used the excuse that the bartender was slammed, but when I looked over there, only 3 or 4 people were sitting at the bar and as I said, the restaurant was nowhere near full. I will never go back to this place.

Oh, and the food was overpriced and not that great. I should have went to Taco Bell.",-0.572

Sorry but the red enchilada sauce you use from the can purchased at a grocery store just doesn't cut it. $50 for a small meal that was horrible and leaves you hating life the day after is totally not worth it.

We saw the bus and assumed it was like the others ""Mexican food"". Negative, it was bad, the flavors didn't go together, 3.99 for one taco and most of all the service was lousy. Basically 4 tacos and 2 drinks $20. 

We will Never go back and do not recommend this place for the simple fact that they do not know tacos. Stick to what you know please.",-0.8406
"Didn't even get to eat here and had the worst customer service experience. I walked in to order a meal to go because my hotels bistro didn't open till 5pm and it's only around 12:30. The smiley waitress said they can't do to go orders (which baffles my mind) because of the traffic coming in today and some event near by. An order is an order, either I wait in a booth or on my feet, whats the difference? If I order in a booth and then asK for a to go box will you not give it to me? She told me other places may not be offering to go also. Having a short amount of time due to having to fly out I didn't want to walk all over Tampa looking for a place to put in a to go order. I walked right next door to Anise and they were willing to accommodate. First impressions are everything and that waitress at Taps was not a good one. I come to Tampa all the time for work, I will never step foot into your establishment, and I will pass it along.",-0.5405
"My family and I have been to this restaurant a dozen of times and I will say they are consistent on one thing, bad service. Why do we go back, because till today the food was worth the considerable long wait and there is no other Mexican restaurants in or near Riverview. I have sent my food  back several times for being undercooked and actually had a whole glass of soda accidentally poured all over me and not one time did the manager come to our table and apologize. Today we requested to speak with the manager because our food was incorrect and he stared at us with not an ounce of apology or concern and just  stated he would take it off  our bill. We will not go back again, I am done giving this restaurant chances to get it together and always being sorely disappointed.",-0.6705
"I travel a lot and always order takeout or delivery after a long day of work. I was hungry...but too tired to drive around looking for a restaurant. I decided to see what places delivered to my hotel room. Ahhhhh I find Taco Bus! Who doesn't love tacos right? WRONG!! The guy dropped off a plate of slop to my door. No utensils! It said the order came with a fountain drink....not a warm can of soda. I ordered a burrito and whatever they gave me was a cold gooey mess of something unrecognizable. I guess I will sip on my warm can of Diet Coke and toss this in the trash since i don't even have a fork or knife to inspect what the hell it is.

Update!
So I ran down 8 flights of stairs to find a knife and fork from the hotel cafe. I inspected the ""burrito"" and it's nothing but fatty gristle with old yellow wilted lettuce mixed in....and I think their green peas in this? Some weird green little balls that kind of resemble peas. In the trash it goes!",-0.9077

"We have heard good things about Taco Bus from friends, so we decided to try it for the first time and it was a complete nightmare. We waited 7 minutes for our order to be taken and the place was not busy. It took another 16 minutes to get our order brought to our table (4 burritos should not take that long to make). The music was loud, there were no carbonated drinks (we drank water) and they also ran out of rice. Not sure why the cashier would offer Mexican rice if they do not have any. 

I asked for a refund for my rice and the cashier charged me again for my meal! She got an attitude and blamed it on the manager not being there. Indeed, you can tell managerial presence was missing. She finally got a hold of the manager by phone who told her how to give a credit. It took another 10 minutes and at the end she told me that if I still had a problem to come see the manager another day because she did all she could do. She was rude and very disrespectful, she acted like all this was my fault. By the way, our meals were nothing to talk about, cold and not tasty. I truly do not recommend this place to anyone and I don't plan to eat at this or any of their locations again. Extremely disappointing... Should have gone to Moe's or Chipotle.",-0.8852

After buying the Yelp $10 for $15 deal and filling up my online cart with my order, it would not let me choose a pick up time. So I called and no one picked up. Not going to drive 15 min to probably see they've locked up early. That's the impression I get anyways... employees don't want to deal with a new customer order 40 min before closing.. I might be wrong, but we will never know. Want my money back for the yelp deal. Boo",-0.4787

Paid $9 for Mac and Cheese on the sharing menu which was so small that it's impossible to share and was blah. $3 for a ginger ale that was never refilled the entire night. If it's not free refills then the slightly flat ginger ale was definitely not worth it. 
Was with a group and gratuity was added to my individual check automatically and the tip was calculated at about 22% which was way more than what the waitress deserved for the lack of service.",-0.17
"Firstly, I'm from Wisconsin. We have sub-standard Mexican food there. By comparison, Wisconsin Mexican is Gourmet. This was, by far, the worst Mexican food I've ever eaten. My hardshell taco was a pile of mush. My chimichanga was 4"" of rolled up, deep fried soft taco shell with a smattering of rice and chicken. It had zero flavor and was so dry you could sand furniture with it. The hostess was very rude to a member of our party and extremely curt while seating us.

I grant Mi Casa zero stars, and plead for them to quit the food service business and reconsider their collective career choices.",-0.4927

We got a burrito, 2 tacos, and a water for just under $20. We added guac and sour cream to each... we wish we didn't. The guac looks like it came out of a squeeze bottle and didn't taste fresh at all. The burrito was all filler and very little of the shredded pork I ordered. The tacos as can be seen were a bunch of shredded lettuce and not much else. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE.",-0.1436

A third table sat down and was looking over the menu. 15 minutes later one of the servers decides to take the order of the table that walked in after us. Instead of stopping by our table on the way to put their order in he completely ignores our table.

"It's sad for me to be writing this but save yourself the trouble and go to a different Fuzzy's. I have been coming here for some time now and the quality has gone down like CRAZY the last 3 months. No there's nothing the management can do to change my opinion, nor do I want the ""management"" to post a reply that he pulled right out of his ass, as the management there is non existent. Every time I come in, i'm slapped in the face with the vibe of awkward tension. The cooks look unhappy to be there, the bartenders seem to be judging every one from afar, and From what I've realized, the actual manger who's name is Adam I believe, cannot run the store at all. I will sit there and watch him attempt to tell someone what to do, but fails miserably at coming off as an authoritative figure. Who hired this guy? I can just tell no one there has respect for him, as I honestly can expect after getting a feel for this new guy. There is no customer engagement from the managers, just again... looks from a distance. This is insane to me. It truly shows when the owners don't care about their investment, fuzzys. This is a prime example of a company that won't be here for much longer. Explains why they're never that busy any more. Hire new management that will make the team evolve into something great. What you have now is only bringing you down. I forgot to mention, I've always been insanely pleased with the people taking my orders, the servers have their jobs on check for the most part. It's the management that needs some adjusting. Won't be coming here again I can tell you that.",-0.8916

"It's been awhile since I've been here, and I wish I had went to Tijuana Flats instead.  We ordered online, so there was no reason there should have been any screw ups with the order, but there were.  We ordered several fish tacos, and there wasn't even half a small fish filet on each taco!  There was just tiny, scrap pieces of fish, and it tasted ""fishy""
The hard shell taco I ordered barely had a tablespoon of ground beef on it!  It was SO disappointing!  Then the burrito my son ordered had cilantro lime rice that wasn't completely cooked, as most of the rice was hard.  The only things that were""okay"" were the refried beans and chips & guacamole.  
The first time we went to Fuzzy's was awesome, so I guess staff has changed since then, because it's obvious this group of staff cared nothing about the quality of the food.  I only called the restaurant to complain about one of the fish tacos, that had toppings on it that we had requested be removed when we ordered online, but I really should have complained about the entire meal being crap!  It was a waste of money, and I probably would've been more satisfied with a combo from Taco Bell!  And it would've been half the price!

I have never had food poisoning in my 20 years of life, and I know specifically that it was this food bc it's the only thing I ate the entire day and I woke up the next day in a horrible condition. I was scared to eat here for awhile because of horror stories I heard but I thought they may have redeemed themselves, only for me to get outrageously sick.

"I don't even know where to start. I met a friend here for dinner last Thursday, November 2, 2017.  When we arrived my friend noted that it smelled like dirty mop. I didn't notice it at first so we proceeded with our order. She ordered her food with no tomatoes and when she went to pick it up it had tomatoes on it. When she asked the three young men behind the counter that served her about it, they just stared at her. When she got to the table her bowl looked dirty like it had been used for something else and the trays were also dirty as if they had been used for lunch service and not cleaned or wiped off. My food seemed OK but all the other issues made me not feel good about eating there. The outside area smelled like trash and was dirty and rarely clean when customers left. We had to walk back inside and inquire with the bartender why we have not received our margaritas. She said she didn't even know about them, the cashier didn't let her know we ordered drinks. We basically made the decision there that we probably wouldn't return unless we heard better reviews. Unfortunately, my connection with the restaurant did not end there. Later that evening I was deathly ill and believe I had food poisoning. I won't go into detail but I was deathly ill with symptoms associated with food poisoning. I had eaten here one other time and had a decent experience. That's why I returned to catch up with a good friend. The only good thing of the evening was the company. I will not return to this restaurant in the future.",-0.976

I just moved here from the Chicago area.... this is the worst place I've ever been to! This is NOT Tacos - if you think it is, you haven't had real Tacos. Taco Bell is better than this! Not only that but 30+min wait on the crap food??!!! Sad part is, they weren't even slammed, busy yes NOT SLAMMED! People who ordered after us even got their food faster. No excuse for a ""quick/fast food"" establishment. 
Everything was cold, beans were a bowl of salt, taco shell was disgusting, sauce in their bottle was Louisiana sauce, rice was not even close to Uncle bens it was was gross, cheddar cheese on tacos??!!! I asked for cilantro, what did I get? PARSLEY - it's NOT the same thing! 
Bar service so pathetic! 3 bartenders, not a full bar to even take care of but took almost 10min for ONE BEER

Nope, don't think so! When you walk into the place. The decor is awful. Like looks they just threw paint on the walls & the most tacky decor they could find. The tv's in the bar area showed the Verizon logo, like they didn't have any service. It felt hot & humid. The smell of the place was awful. After a few minutes of being there, I was already skeptical. But you can't judge a book by its cover.

"Service and quality have deteriorated severly over my last 2 visits. I guess the thrill of good food is gone and management has become lax. Very poor service (attitude) and quality of food has now fallen below taco bell. Good bye taco bus. Pay attention or you will die from poor management and attention to detail.",-0.742
"I'd give 0 stars if I could based on customer service alone. I walked in to this Chipotle (4/13/19) and ordered a chicken quesadilla and a chicken burrito bowl. I ended up leaving mortified based on the way I was spoken to by the girl taking my order. I ordered CHICKEN and the girl kept telling me they were holding on steak. I asked what the meant and she told me in a very condescending manner that it means that they're out of steak and that it'll be about 10 minutes before they have more steak. I think I was justifiably confused because I didn't order steak and didn't know how that pertained to my order. I was then told that I need to learn how to order a ""bowl"" because I ordered the wrong thing and that's why I was getting a burrito instead of the ""burrito bowl"" I asked for. I have never been spoken to by people representing an establishment and I was so embarrassed as there were customers behind me and employees behind the counter who had heard the exchange. I then went to pay, when my quesadilla had been completely forgotten about by the employees, and I had very obviously inconvenienced them by asking for it since I ordered it. I didn't even bother to ask for chips. To me, this is completely unacceptable and I will NEVER visit this location again.",-0.9098
"My wife and I have eaten Mexican food all over the country, this could possibly the worst ever!!! Got the steak, pork, chicken tacos and they were all overcooked. I meat was so chewy and tough, no flavor, the only thing good was the fresh tortillas. Never again, i would give zero stars if possible!!!",-0.6164
"Horrible quality.  Empty booths unusable because they hadn't been cleaned off, yet the restaurant was empty.  Queso was watered down and tasted like hot cheesy water.  If you ever order double meat, ask for it on the side.  Ordering it just puts another $1 in their pocket otherwise.  After 10 minutes we had to go ask for the remainder of our order they forgot.  No one offered refills, asked about quality, etc.  The manager just expedited meals and ran right back to the kitchen.  Imagine the manager couldn't even deliver our order without forgetting a portion.  I will drive to the Land O Lakes TF in the future.  Or I'll just stop @ the Moe's or Chipotle that I pass on the way.",-0.7906
"The menu is big and confusing with tons of small text. It was cheaply printed and nailed onto the wall. Quite a contrast to the LED displays at most restaurants. I feel like I am in post-Maria San Juan. 

The price of a big burrito is $12, a few dollars more than chipotle and not worth the extra cost. I felt compelled to tip when prepaying at the counter, but I regret having done that.

They have four total customers in the store and the two employees managed to temporarily lose my order. It seems they can't process two orders in their head without a computer to tell them what they need to do next. This may be an indication of everyone's very near future. 

It took more than 30 minutes to get the burrito and it was not worth the wait.",-0.8422
"I am a fish taco lover.  I was not impressed with the Taco Bus fish tacos.  Very greasy.  There was not much flavor in the pico.  The red salsa was flavorful.  One homeless person came in to fill her water bottles and use the bathroom for a very long time.  Two more homeless came in for soda.  
I won't eat here again even if I was wasted.",-0.2392
"Have come back a few times and finally have to say enough is enough here. Still same horrible product being shamefully passed out that drive thru window.

"in one word, disgusting! From the moment that you go inside, the place stinks. eventhough the bad smell i just try to give it a shot, i regreted it. i could go to McDonalds that is in the corner and have a good experience. I asked for a fried red snapper, they gave me a small ""grilled"" one that was raw and the seasoning was disgusting. I should go to wash my mouth to remove that horrible flavor.  the fries too oily, i couldnt eat and they charge me $44 for that!!...with that money i could eat lobbster in a better place!

"So it was my birthday today 5/23 and I had seen this indian restaurant had opened about 10mins out from where I live. I checked it up on yelp and saw three great reviews. I decided to go there for dinner and take my wife and four month old baby. After going through all the shenanigans that come with getting a baby into the car we got to ""curry in a hurry"" only to find the it had closed down ""in a hurry"" and I'm not saying for the night it seemed to have either gone out of business or had been permanently closed, although there was a sign saying that they were looking for staff. Eitherway I was very annoyed and upset about this!!! I am hoping that yelp takes this listing down as it is very misleading! Ended up having a crying baby and had to settle for fast food!! Ugh!",-0.8367
"The worst experience, I bought a gift card from them a $120 card, I was able to used it once for less than $20 and now they are saying than the card has  nothing on it. I tried to contact a manager, but without luck, he never answered any of my messages. Besides all that issues I when there the last time I ordered a steak quesadilla and they gave me chicken but they charged me as steak, they said because they where out of steak, but they never tell me that when I paid, they decided they do have steak, so they exchanged the chicken quesadilla for steak but the new quesadilla was like half the portion with only few little pieces of steak. I still cannot believe how they decided to steal me like that.",-0.5886

My party of 12 left because it was so hot. I'm so disappointed and won't be back anytime soon because they don't even know when the air conditioning will be fixed. There's another Taps in Tampa so why even come to this one anymore. Ridiculous! I feel bad for the people that have to work in such conditions.",-0.8516
"I had always been a huge supporter of Estella's for about 10 years. That all ended when my wife and I went for an early dinner on Monday evening. 

Having been a regular for years we sort of had a routine of chips and queso, salsas (including the hotter on for me) followed by our meals which we would take most of home. 

This week was no different. The wife ordered her 2 tacos and I the #1 combo with beef. After filling up on the chips and salsa I wound up only having the taco there and brought the 2 burritos and rice home. As we left my wife wanted to go to the little ice cream shop down the street. 

No sooner had we gotten inside the ice cream shop and a bout of food poisoning stated up. It's now been over 40 hrs since the leaving the restaurant and the fever, stomach pain and other even more undesirable symptoms still exist. This is the worst bout of food poisoning I can ever remember having. I know for a fact that the poising came from the meal I/we ate at Estella's on Monday 3/26. My guess is the contaminated item on this visit was the spicy salsa since its the only thing I had which the wife did not.

Since reading some other reviews where others having repeatedly gotten food poising at multiple of their locations ...... I'll NEVER go again. I have had problems with about a dozen visits to Estella's over the last 10 years where I'd have immediate stomach issues thereafter but never really chalked it up the food quality or food poisoning for one reason or another. Looking back on it now, the last visit prior to this one also left myself and a coworker with food poisoning after having lunch at the location on S Dale Mabry. 

Now begins the search for the best Mexican place in the bay (any suggestions welcome).

Worst experience I've ever had at chipotle and so disappointing. We had to wait 10 minutes for steak because the girl didn't cook the steak when asked and then it took so long to get them that the burritos were cold. Stale chips and very few of the tables wiped. Maybe they do better when they aren't busy but I'm not coming back to see. Doubtful that my boyfriend will want to take me to Chipotle at all since both experiences have been awful.",-0.9013

"We went to this location last night (8/27/19)as a last minute dinner option. There was only one person in front of us who happened to be an employee of this location. Service was fast, but rude. There was one male employee who was in charge of the toppings who was extremely rude to his coworker as well as myself & guest. He was visibly irritated & ready to go. He was short with his responses when asked the difference between the hot, medium & mild salsas. He then proceed to throw our side of queso on the counter towards the cash register. I couldn't take it anymore at that point. I explained to him & the cashier that he needed to go home if he was going to have a bad attitude and treat customers rude. He has no business working in the service industry! Then to top things off... I asked for the vinaigrette dressing to go with my salad & was first told that they didn't have any then the cashier gave me red chili salsa.... no thank you to this chipotle or any chipotle ever again!",-0.9329
"So if I can't find something nice to say about a restaurant I don't usually write a review.  I understand restaurant work is hard and waitstaff don't make great money but here's my story.  Four people arrived at 3:30 on a Sunday.  The restaurant was virtually empty.  It took 25 minutes from the time we ordered until we receive our order.  One order, bean and beef burrito no sour cream.  It came with sour cream.  One order a beef burrito no beans inside.  It came with beans.  I ordered charro beans with my order and got refried beans.  The refill of my unsweetened tea was sweet tea.  And while I understand I live in FL,  I hate sweet tea.  So our waitress scores 25% accuracy.  The food was merely  ok.  We won't be back.  I am giving one star because the post won't update with no stars.",-0.5808
"Omg seriously where do I even start. This place is a horrible mess!  And I'm not even the type to here on fast food joints but this place got me going the two times were have ordered here. First off, I don't care what time it is, the workers should always at least show some sense of urgency or make the customer at least think they're working. We saw at least 4 people just standing around inside from the drive thru not doing jack. There was only one cast ahead of us and it took almost 20 min till we got to the window. When we finally did get our food, it was the worst bean burrito a person can ever make. I mean how can you mess that up?!  The bean burrito probably had beans that's been sitting out all day to night. For God sake I know it was like 11pm but you guys are open late!  We ordered a couple other things and I'm not even gonna bother talking about those. And what kind of taco Bell establishment don't care to ask if you want sauces. I really wanna try to say something good about this place but I just can't. So yeah, to my fellow Yelpers, just about this location is my advice.",-0.8982
"I just moved to Tampa and usually love moes where ever I go. This moes in particular is just not good. They don't even do the moes greeting if they don't feel like it. They carry on conversations with each other making the customers repeat themselves repeatedly as if we're impededing on their time. The fixings are a mess. They are mixes in with each other and of course the staff couldn't care less. And on top of that the food is just not good.  Will not be going back to this moves. I should have known something was up when  nobody was In there. Moes is never empty. But this one was dead. For a good reason. Go somewhere else.",-0.8915
"Our order was messed up and the food was nasty. Instead of a side of queso we received an extra kids taco meal. The chicken in the tacos had absolutely no flavor. The double cheesy tacos had next to no queso. The blackened chicken on the salad tasted like it was grilled for 45 minutes and then thrown in the microwave for awhile to make sure it was cooked. For ""Tex Mex"", none of the food had any flavor. Never going back.",-0.734
"My experience at Vallartas was horrible. My boyfriend and I arrived at 630 pm last Saturday night. We were quickly ushered to our table and served salsa and chips by the bartender. After munching on broken Salsa chips for 35 mins, we still had not been approached by a waitress to take our drink order much less our food order. My boyfriend looked around the restaurant and noticed 14 other tables with people who only had salsa and chips like we did. They had no food either. My boyfriend got up to used the bathroom and happened to looked into the kitchen. He saw 4 people in the kitchen standing around doing nothing. There's not anything to be cooked, there was not a single pot on any stove, and not a morsel of food being prepared or out in the kitchen. 2 of the men were staring out the order intake window doing nothing, while the other 2 men were idly standing as there was nothing to cook. There were at least 14 tables with salsa and chips waiting for food that was never going to arrive. On returning to our table, my boyfriend and decided to leave feeling sorry for the poor suckers waiting for food that was never to come. Check out the other Vallartas locations in Tampa, for we had much better experiences there.",-0.836

I should've listened to my instincts when I asked the guy taking my order about certain kind of meat and he said ""I don't know, I've never had any of this food""... I should've walked at that moment ..

"Very disappointing experience as I was thrilled to have a new Mexican restaurant in our neighborhood. I believe first impressions are everything. As we walked in... the owner greeted us, but was extremely rude and arrogant. With smiles on our face we asked him kindly if he was planning on having any life music in the future, he rudely responded by saying ""THIS IS A RESTAURANT, NOT A BAR""  That's  funny because the bar  takes up most of the square footage. No music... not even a Mariachi Band?!?! Dahhhh

The margaritas were way over priced and were not impressed with the quality. Also, I think charging for chips and salsa is ridiculous. Food was nothing to write home about either.

On a positive note the staff were all very kind but some complained about the owners attitude and tactics. Doesn't seem there is a lot of positive morale happening at this restaurant. Sad. My advice to the owner is if he wants to win over our South Tampa Family, he needs to get an attitude adjustment and jump off his high horse.

I will not be going back. Two thumbs down...",-0.5229
"Well first off it was my girlfriend's ( who is afro-latina) and i first time here we asked the guy who took our order a few questions about the menu and he was kinda aloof about everything but we got our order and as I said I was our first time so we asked where we could sit he said any where you would like... After this we apparently sat in the ""full service"" part of the place. We sat there for a few min and then I realized I had to go out in the chip and dip order which was no problem. Apparently when I got up to do so a guy in a red shirt and beard came up and was asking my girlfriend why she was sitting there. She was confused saying the man at the front said we can sit anywhere. He cut her off and tried to direct her to a sign on the table and he said it says right here this is full-service if you placed an order at the front it next time don't sit here. She was not even able to read it and if the person who took our order would have told us that we would not have sat there. The man in the red shirt with the beard was pretty rude to her and of course he waited till I was not there to say anything and then when I came back he just kept looking at us with this upset look.... Which made the whole experience very awkward so we ate and basically as fast as we could and left. the tacos were okay nothing really to brag about the guacamole was good.but again for a place that should be about customer service and us being customers it was very lackluster and to be honest quite infuriating that he would choose when I get up to go leave to say something to my girlfriend that she sits there alone. Based on this experience I'd never come back here... Subpar tacos bad customer service so yeah it was not bad priced  but again shitty customer service and my girlfriend felt discriminated against because again the gentleman in the red shirt with the beard kept giving us dirty looks the whole time we were eating",-0.9846

"Really, really not good. The service was bad. We were seated outside and waited 15 minutes before someone came to greet us and take or order. I ordered the beef picadillo tacos on soft corn tortillas. Our server warned that the corn tortillas were soft but would fall apart easily. I ordered it anyway and even though they doubled up on the tortillas, I still could not pick it up. It split on the bottom and fell apart. The filing fell on the plate. They were not home made tortillas, they were cold and nasty. The menu actually says that they serve their food ""warm"", and we should let the server know if we preferred of hot. I've eaten at many, many restaurants and never had I seen that on a menu. Still scratching my head on that one. The rice was clumpy and cold. Yes, cold. The beans were placed atop the rice and were only slightly warmer. The meal was inedible. I told our server and she said she would send over the manager which she never did. I asked her to take the tacos back and I ordered the cheese enchiladas instead. They were served in a oval bowl on a plate, with rice and beans on the plate. The enchiladas are filled with canned queso, not cheddar and onion or Mexican cheese. It would take me a second to throw this together in my own kitchen. That is not why I came to this restaurant. I wanted food that I could not make at home. I wanted authentic Mexican food. Do not go there expecting that you will get any. It's expensive. I could have as more authentic and better tasting taco at taco bell honestly. I was very disappointed. Less than mediocre food, slow, lousy service and staff who do not care. Eating out is not cheap. You want to be pleased with everything. The server did not offer to take my meal off the bill, and I didn't ask, but nobody should have been charged for the kind of experience I had.

The ingredients are poor quality, the beef is full of nerves and fat, overfilled dishes with rice, diced tomato not ripe enough (tasteless,) the shredded cheese taste like fake cheese and cold dishes.
Perhaps because they are growing in many locations they forgot that the number one recipe for success is quality food.

He seemed a bit frazzled and stressed although you guys werent very busy at all. I ordered a chili and a salad.  My friend asked to order something to go, he had a puzzled look on his face and answered yes. She ordered something to go since she wasn't going to be able to stay as long as I could. After my food came out, Dylan said her food would come out later ""since she ordered it to go"" since she was under a time constraint we asked how long it would take to have it in the restaurant instead. He went into the kitchen and came back and said the ordered couldn't be fulfilled TOGO. I think this is completely ridiculous. After waiting for her food she wasn't allowed to get it the way she ordered it.  If this has been communicated at the beginning we would have proceeded differently. She had to leave without any food.

"If I could give this disgusting place zero stars I would. Never write reviews, but the absolute carelessness with which my food was thrown together all while knowing that I paid for it really pisses me off. New to the area, thought I'd give it a shot for some takeout. No line whatsoever, yet the ""burrito"" I was given was less than half the size of a chipotle burrito and was swimming in a pool of tomato juice with shredded lettuce scattered about and was soggy like a sponge as though it had been prepared for  a customer three hours before who never showed up. Staff was friendly but the food was undeniably the worst Mexican I have ever had. If I had not already left before opening it then I would have taken it back immediately. Also the worst guacamole ever, little flavor and mixed mostly with tomatoes that were grainy and stale. Only positive were the chips that went with it, but I'm sure they bought those. Absolutely gross food, I hope I don't get food poisoning. Even Chipotle could show this place a thing or two. Stay away",-0.407
"Horrible!
This is how we received our uber eats from taco bus. We ordered 9 tacos. We received 2 actual tacos without any toppings, empty taco shells and some chips and salsa. 
When we called taco bus, they said they were understaffed and there was nothing they could do for us.

I've never spent less than 20 minutes at this location, even on a day where there are only 3 people there placing orders. I've tried again and again thinking that maybe I've just come on bad days, but unfortunately through all the rotations of employees they've had in the last year, the only thing that has been consistent here has been the disappointment I experience after every visit.

I've also never received an order that was correct. I asked for 2 loaded nacho tacos. What do I get? Two potato soft tacos. Ask for sauce. ""It's in the bag"", yet when I get back to the office, there's no sauce. Pay extra for extra nacho cheese? It's inevitably less than I would usually get if I didn't request extra. 

I don't often eat fast food, but I would love to have fast easy options near work for busy days where I'm not able to bring lunch. Unfortunately, McDonald's is the only half decent place in the vicinity. Save yourself the trouble and avoid this place like the plague.",-0.9659

"Absolutely rude and disgusting service from server B. We were seated late around 9:30pm. I don't  know if she was given a table and she didn't want or what her issue was. Right off the back she was short with us. She took our drink order and just walked away...like turns her back to us while we are in mid sentence. We weren't done yet. We went to order an appetizer and walked away, before we were done. We had a party of 4 adults. Extremely short, and just down right rude. 45 mins for our food to arrive, granted they had just been slammed, other tables seated next to us complaining about the wait of their food. We sat patiently and did not complain. When the food finally came out, my dinner was wrong and we were missing a dinner salad. I explained to the runner my order was wrong. The server come over and I explain to her what was wrong and she catches an even bigger attitude with me. I tell her I don't want this. She snatched my plate from my hand and didn't offer to fix it or apologize . I catch the manager on duty and pull him to the side away from our table to explain the issue we were having with the server. He never apologized, didn't offer to fix anything. At that point I don't want anything replaced, I don't want anything free I just want her to NOT serve us. Guess who comes back with the check? The same rude server. I'm astonished that I bring an issue to management and nothing gets fixed, no apology or any offer remedy the situation. Chuy's is our favorite place.

Tables aren't bussed, no paper towels and soap in the restroom to wash hands and a nasty floor.

"The absolute worst service I have ever received! Our waitress was out right rude and nonexistent when she discovered that I wasn't drinking alcohol. She didn't even give my wife a chance to order a cocktail. She turned and said, ""I'll give you more time."" She returned 15 mins later and wouldn't even look at us when we ordered. She literally was looking everywhere, but us. Then the food...my wife ordered the salmon sandwich and it was good (I would order that again), but the chicken paillard was pitiful. The chicken breast they over-cooked was, no BS, the size of a hockey puck. It was terribly dry and lacking seasoning. I truly believe the waitress made a concerted effort to make my meal unsatisfying. She never came to refill drinks or ask how the food was. 

Now, I'm a fast eater and my wife is not. It is not uncommon for one person to finish before the other. With that being said, it is EXTREMELY rude to pick up the empty plate and drop the check without the other person finishing or even asking if we'd like dessert. Not only will we never return to this place, but I truly hope the establishment retrain or hire a new waitress or waiter for Saturday evenings. Our waitress was the worst I've ever experienced.",-0.9041

NONE of the staff had masks and the Manager was running around shouting (read: spittle likely leaving his mouth) and also maskless. The tables outside were full of more maskless ppl. I cancelled my order. I like the food here but I will never support this location again. You've had plenty of time to create a safe and thoughtful way to approach higher demand days.

"Sadly this was one of the worst taco Tuesday , let's try something new! So after calling the store in Tampa from 5:24pm -5:40 pm and being hung up on once and then finally someone answered and told me no call ins orders were too busy! Went online order only to get to the store there's 2 people in line and this is what they call busy! $50 plus dollars and only thing that was good was guacamole,(addition $6) the Queso (additional $6)and chips! 
The white line rice had no flavor, black beans were worse then cheap canned , lettuce was wilted and brown around the edges, sauces were below average, , cilantro was not fresh, had corn and flour tortillas they were very stale tasting, the chicken very fatty and the steak was Rock hard and horrible tasting , very very disappointed and I wish I could get a refund because 90% of the food my animals wouldn't even touch so it went in the garbage and of course the stores not answering the phone now !",-0.9598
"I've dined at the Boston location several times and was never disappointed. I was visiting my daughter at college in Tampa and thought that Bartaco would be a great night out. I was wrong. I called ahead from the Tampa Riverwalk to put our name on the list. We were told it would be 75 minutes but we had to check-in at the front desk within 30 minutes in order to confirm our spot on the list. So we wrapped up our Riverwalk walk and drove to Hyde Park to check in. As most of the shops in the area were already closed, we just hung around the entrance for another 20 minutes when I asked the hostess if they served drinks to those that were waiting. She said that there is a waiter walking around taking drink orders and she would send him over to our bench outside the restaurant. This was not true. After another 40 minutes there was nobody taking drink orders. In fact, the only way to get a drink was to sit at a table and scan the QR code to start an order. After a total of 90 minute wait, we were finally seated. Due to COVID, there are no waiters/waitresses. There have food runners who bring your food and drinks as you order them on your phone. Someone brought over water but that was the last we saw of him. After ordering our drinks, appetizer, and meals in one order, the runner showed up with the drinks. She also had a bottle of coca-cola for another table. As she unloaded our drinks on our table, the coke bottle fell over onto our table and bounced down onto the booth bench soaking my wife's sweater and jeans. The runner froze and didn't know what to do. I asked her to grab a bar rag behind her and we all started soaking up the coke on the table and bench. At this point, a manager comes over and asked if everyone is OK. But she quickly leaves before waiting for a response and she has a look of disgust on her face as if we disrupted her evening. While my wife was in the bathroom drying her sweater and jeans, our appetizer and entrees come out all at once. At this point, we also need more water but there is no waitstaff to check in with us and the runners just drop food on the table and leave without engaging in conversation. The food is decent. Not as good as I remembered from my Boston dining experience but passable for sure. We decided to order a dessert. After dessert I paid the bill using my phone and was thinking that they'd atleast comp us for a round of drinks or the dessert. No such luck. While paying, the default tip is set to 18%. I decided to give no tip, or maybe a $1 to make a point. But in the end I regrettably donated the 18%. This just seemed strange given that we placed the order and paid the bill ourselves, while the incompetent runners made you feel like they just wanted you out of there as soon as possible. We won't return to Bartaco Tampa. Ever. We might visit the Boston location again but not for along time. There are too many good restaurants in Tampa to waste your time and money on this over-hyped pretentious street taco establishment.",-0.9817
"This place was disgusting. 

I'm normally not that harsh with late night places, but taco bus deserves it. Two items in our order, spicy chicken burrito with guac and a chicken quesadilla. The burrito was barely warm, hardly no chicken and the quesadilla never touched the grill. They served us a uncooked quesadilla. Like, cold food and no attempt at heating it. 

The service sucked. They stare at you like you're speaking tongues at them and then hurry you out the door. 

Do not eat here. If your options are taco bus or starvation, then starve.",-0.5949
"Walked in with 2 other people and order a box lunch with no extra. Waited over 15 minutes for my two friends to get their order. Then someone ordering after me got their food.  Then two more people that ordered after got their food. 
  There was only on person helping inside orders and 3 working the drive thru. after getting the manager's attention he told me that they were doing drive thru with 3 employees. Again only 1 employee working on 10 orders alone. 
  Finally after almost 30 minutes of waiting the manager made my food. The manager says that he can get me a free box lunch on my next visit but I would have to wait till he got a moment to process it. I only get 30 minutes for lunch and I still had to drive back to work so I'm already late and he wants me to wait long. 
  Unbelievable. needles to say this is the worst Taco Bell i have ever visited. If I were the owner of this franchise I would be looking for a better crew. Did I mention that this is not the first time that this place has messed up an order.

Doubt it will last another year.",-0.8152

We heard the toilet flush but never heard water run.  The other person was eating the entire time we were there.  They forgot my sour cream and guacamole and when I asked for it, the one eating asked the other if she put it in my quesadilla. She said ""oh she doesn't remember"" so gave me a cup of each but I couldn't use them because I was just watching her eating tacos while waiting to be helped.

In reply to whoever's writing the response to this company's reviews. 
Their business produces the same piss poor quality food as the piss poor response that I received. 
Sarasota is a small town and news travel's very quickly. After 30 + years living in Sarasota I've seen plenty of crap on an a platter or in this case in a box.

"Haven't even tasted the food yet and will never come back. Placed a $70 take out order for the family (12 tacos, 2 burritos, one soup) and the salsas, cheese, limes, cilantro etc is self serve. They have little plastic containers to pack them into, which is fine. No issue there. To save myself time and also use less plastic, I opted to use foam cups to take the toppings in. Was told I'd be charged $5 each even though the amount would've been the same if I filled 8 different plastic containers. The cost is negligible, especially if you see I just spent the amount. 
For a couple of foam cups, this place will never see my business again. 

I don't blame the staff but management for such  shortsightedness. The hostess was pleasant and she said she got in trouble for allowing me to use the cups.

"So it's Cinco de Mayo and of course wanted some Mexican food from Tijuana Flats (Lutz). I was going to have it delivered but then saw it was going to be an hour before arrival so I ordered curbside which was only 30 mins. I arrive at the time my email said it would be ready, text the number they say to text with your order number and food is supposed to be out within a relatively short period of time. I get that it's their busiest day of the year so I'm willing to wait. 30 mins goes by and nothing, there's about 30 people in the restaurant, no social distancing whatsoever. There's another 10 or so people waiting outside. The girls I see bringing food out are wearing short shorts ( I don't care about that) but one of them kept pulling her shorts out her a$$ with the same hand she's handing food to people ‍. The girls delivering to cars were walking around the whole parking lot looking for people. It was a disaster. After 45 mins I go inside to see if someone could just hand me my food and a guy took my order info, went to the back and never came back. Another person complains and the girl's response was that ""people in the back aren't communicating well and orders are piling up"". Unacceptable! So after waiting an hour I go to her to cancel my order and get my refund. She wrote down my name and order number and I said how do I know that I'll be refunded? She said ""the manager goes through tickets at end of the night and refunds the ones not picked up and money should be refunded in 1-3 business days"". So right now I have no faith in how accurate this statement is but best believe I better get my money. Whoever owns this store and is the manager are terrible. I know there's a pandemic right now and it's Cinco de Mayo but this was piss poor planning at this store. At some point management should've stopped orders after a certain point and taken care of the people who are waiting. People were walking around in circles, most orders being called out was of nobody in the store, no announcement were made about running behind with a time frame, no leadership at all. Needless to say, you guys will never see my money again because of this. If I could give zero stars I would.",-0.9592

"My husband, my two boys, and I recently visited Mi Casa and left utterly frusterated. When we arrived the hostess stared at us blankly as if she had no clue why we just walked in the door and asked if we were ""already with someone"". I told her it was the four of us and she really looked confused then. When we finally were sat, she put us between to full tables even though there were several open tables throughout the restaurant. It took over 15 minutes just to place our drink order! Then at least another 5 just to recieve our round of ice waters and chips & salsa. Our waitress (I want to say her name was April, bleach blonde hair) was very unattentive and had to ask us to repeat our orders several times. By the time we had finally ordered our food, it was nearly 45 minutes and we were already contemplating leaving at that point. The restaurant was buzzing with servers, yet our table and the two around us were completely ignored. I watched one couple get up and leave because of the lack of service and the hostess didn't seem to care at all. When our food arrived it had OBVIOUSLY been sitting under a heating lamp for a LONG time. Our beans were literally crispy around the edges, the cheese on top completely burnt, and the garnish of lettuce was browned. My kids order quesadillas & fries, and a taco & beans, and neither one of them hardly touched it because ""it was yucky"". I don't blame them! I ordered the carnitas dinner (supposed to be a tender fried bit of pork served with tortillas). I tried one bite and pushed it away, which our waitress saw and didn't come over. It was so dry, burnt, and brittle it was like little bits of pork flavored saw dust chips. HORRIBLE! Finally waved down another waitress to ask her to send ours over with the check. When she arrived (with no check in hand) she asked if everything was alright due to our full plates. I told her no, that the food was unappealing, unedible, and had clearly been under the lamp for some time. To this she replied, ""oh it was on the stove for too long?"" I told her no, that I had worked food services before, and this was not the kitchens fault. I think she got the point when I told her I would only be paying for my husband and childrens picked over meals and would like mine removed from the bill. With no apology she stormed off to fetch the manager, who adjusted our bill but did not come to our table. We finally got the bill after waiting 10 more minutes. This was honestly the first time Ive ever not only not left a tip, but contemplated walking out without paying!

When I got there people were waiting outside and inside. No hostess to be found for 10 mins. All the staff were on their phones not paying attention.  When the staff finally came over to help the people in line plus people waiting for their pick-up orders, they told us there was a 25-35 min wait on top of having to wait there to even talk to anybody. I just left as i might have to wait longer anyways for food after being seated as I can tell the staff has no sense of urgency at all nor care about customers.",-0.7121
"Their hours are now noon-8pm.  They are constantly out of items and their employees are usually rude about it.   Used to be a great place to stop for food but I would avoid it at all costs now.",-0.431
"I  see that the management and service staff has changed quite often and a lot in the type of people they hire. We come here VERY often and don't think we will continue to spend our money/time here any longer. The staff is SO lazy and rude, like they are too good to be here or actually work. The food is the same (thank goodness....because otherwise they would probably shut down) Get ready to spend a lot of time here waiting around for things you asked for and make sure you are patient enough to ask at least 3 people before you actually get it. Managers don't even care.

Sucks because the service here used to be impeccable to the point where any mistake was okay by us. Now everything comes with an eye roll and scoff that they have to actually do anything for us....funny considering they are in the service industry!!",-0.2147
"Where to start, I'm not very sure. Anything and everything was wrong. Parking is tight, crammed and limited (not very good for dining, rush times). 
Once inside, line really has no were to go. It's a squished area if busy. We came around 9:30 at night, and still a line up to the door. The line moved fairly slow for being so busy. 
Once up to the counter, server seemed stressed and frustrated (definitely not service with a smile) but she did seem to know what she was doing. However, portions she gave could barely pass as a small lunch portion. I barley got any meat and the rice was low as well. I got white rice with carnitas. Cost is about 6.50 or so, and with the portion size I received, was not worth it.
Also, my dad order chips and queso only.
Once we started moving down the line, I asked for mild salsa, they were out. They were also out of 3 other top ingredients for toppings. 
Once we reached the checkout line, the cashier did not seem experienced. Took a very long time to checkout. First problem, it was the cashier that told us that they were out of the chips (should have said that in the beginning). So my dad had to change his order at the checkout line. The cashier did not seem pleased by this and her tone held slight irritation.
Next, after we fixed his order, we were finally checking out, but she forgot my drink. So I mentioned that, she seemed confused. She then started taking things out of my bag. When she did, she used a little bit too much force when placing my requested dressing on the counter, squashing the lid and spilling the contents. She didn't seem happy at all about this. She also forgot my dads drink.
After the chaos at the cashier, we got most of our food and went to sit down. Right away, I noticed the filth that was dropped all over each table and all over the floor. There was trash of straw papers, bits of napkins and lids everywhere. I was a little grossed out. 
Once things settled at the front, the same girl at cashier came out and started to ""clean"" the tables. Regardless, it was left just as dirty, still crumbs all over the surface. 
One positive thing was that the food was decent enough, but that was probably only because I was starving. 
Over all, if this facility wants to stay open, they need to change the parking situation, get their staff more organized to be able to handle large lines professionally, better friendly service and much more cleaner.
I can say based off tonight and every time I've come here, not a pleasant experience. Do not have a desire to return.",-0.9789

"Where do I begin? My husband and I used to frequent Chipotle, especially on night's that we wished to not cook or nights before we travel making it easy on us. TERRIBLE idea on this occasion. I went over to the Chipotle in Brandon shortly after my shift at the hospital for a quick and somewhat healthy meal option. We had plans to travel to San Diego the following day, so knew it would be an easy option as well. 

I walked into the facility around 6:30pm to a huge line, which is normally a good sign, being that many people are there ordering and the food is not just sitting under the lights for hours. When it was my time to order, I ordered the usual - steak bowl with white rice, mild salsa lettuce, cheese, and easy sour cream. This particular occasion was no different except that I normally get extra fajitas and that option was not available to me. 

I quickly raced home to finish my dinner and start packing before our early flight the next day. I didn't think anything of it that evening and it wasn't until I woke up at 2AM with the worst stomach pains of my entire life. So painful that I begged my husband to take me to the hospital, I was in such agony. 

Due to the timing of this and our travel plans, I took a TUMs and decided to try it to sleep it off. I woke up at 4AM, ready for our flight, with even worse pains in my abdomen. Like 8/10 pain. I somehow made it to my flight without dying, but nonetheless, still felt I was going to. 

I made it to Houston (our layover) with even more severe pains. I begged my husband to continue on and leave me at the airport, while I was peeled over in my seat. I cried the entire duration of the flight because of the pain and correlated it to Chipotle the night before. 

Needless the say, our entire trip was ruined because of the severe abdominal pain I was in and vouched to never, in my entire life eat Chipotle again.",-0.9867

"Went there for  late lunch today...around 3:15. Not busy, seated outside.  Took server almost 5 minutes to come to us. We asked for menu and we're told we had to scan the code and use that in our phone. People at other table had menu she wouldn't give us one.  Decided to sweep outside area while we were eating !! Food was ok.  When i got my check $13.97 I gave her a $20 and she asked if I wanted change!!! When she brought back my change I didn't get the coins back.  Not the money but the principle.  Won't be there again!! An hour wasted ....",-0.7067
"What is happening at Chipotle?  The quality of food preparation is going down the tubes. The meat always looks like it's old and over cooked, just doesn't look fresh, they constantly run out of food and some of the workers....I wouldn't let them clean my car let alone cook my food.  I went to Chipotle today, was hoping 
to try the new brisket, when I finally got to the counter and saw the brisket on the line, almost threw up, totally tasty looking. There seems to be just an overall nastiness at Chipotle later, I think the management/ownership just don't care any more cause they think people will just eat anything at a Chipotle...well not me. Gross.",-0.2718

"Alright y'all this visit was ridiculous. Chipotle right across from my house, you'd think real quick and easy. Not leaving with an overstuffed burrito not lackluster service. But that's exactly what I got. Burrito, and 3 soft tacos. The soft taco order was beyond slapped with excess of food, and being SOFT that means an individual wrap on them. Just thrown together in one, causing everything to be mixed. Sloppy and disgusting. My burrito, same deal. Needed two wraps... the objective is be fair on what's chosen but at LEAST give a fair amount of guacamole. The employee had baggy eyes, you can tell she was tired and wanted to leave. Spoke odd to those in front of me, and due to her screw up took too much time. Held up the line, causing her to literally just throw those tacos together. Sad Sunday man. First time at this spot and judging from the reviews the staff and management just don't GAF. Foolish.",-0.8634

"Kicking myself for giving this location another try. I realize pick up is important during these times but the guests standing throughout the store should also be a priority and we are not. Manager at register calling out items for slow cashier leaving 2 people on the line while the other line for pick up has 4. On top of it she is talking to other guests about a guest who questioned portion sizes. Cauliflower rice was good, but they were running low so we each got a half portion for the $2 up charge. Sad that it doesn't matter the time of day, the same issues occur. As I write this there are 25 people in line that is now out the door and manager is still holding up the register.",-0.0928
"Unfortunately what turned out to be a great night with some friends with what seemed to be decent food turned into a nightmare. We were excited to try Chuy's & arrived around 10pm. The food was good & so was the service but 4 out of 5 people in my party ended up with FOOD POISONING! I myself had to go to urgent care the next day because I could not stop vomiting, while the rest of my friends were in bed with bad stomach aches. I spoke to a manager Aaron & told him what happened & he was extremely dismissive with no regards to how we felt. I called again later that night & spoke to another manager who was still dismissive, but at least offered to send dinner for two vouchers in the mail. He said it must have been something we ate before but we all came from different areas of Florida (Jacksonville, Port Saint Lucie, Tampa) & met there. There's no way we all ate at different places in different cities before arriving there & each of them got us that sick.",-0.6809

And he replaced two out of the four tacos. Those had tomatoes on them too!! So I wasn't able to eat anything. Hungry & sad!",-0.8114
"DO NOT get the agua frescas!! They will serve you DAYS OLD rotten juice. I am not kidding. I ordered a mango one and when I got home and took a sip it tasted and even smelled like old wine. If that wasn't bad enough I was asked by a friend if I'd been drinking and that was from a single sip. That means either one of two things: they're either purposefully using rotten or near-rotten fruit before it's considered ""inedible"" and just blending it up anyway, or they're purposefully leaving the same old batch out for DAYS. Absolutely disgusting. To top this all off they messed up my order entirely. I ordered 3 tacos with all toppings, specifically beans, rice, cheese, sour cream, jalapenos and guacamole. NONE of this was on the tacos. No sour cream, beans, rice, guac, or jalapenos. Just COLD meat with cold cheese/cabbage and tomatoes. How hard is it to make and not forget a simple order? They are so clueless here it's not even funny. I won't be coming here again.",-0.8895

"We popped in because this restaurant looked really cute and it was dog friendly. Unfortunately after putting in our order our food came out sporadically. Tacos got soggy and cold as we waited more than 20 minutes between tacos coming out for our entire table of 5 to get their meals. We had different servers coming to ""check in on us"", but none of them helped address the fact that the food was coming out at completely different times. 
Would not recommend especially if you're in a group. Hats off to the cooks because the food tasted decent, the service was terrible.",-0.6449
"I am from Lakeland and normally eat at the taco bus there. I was in Tampa today and decided to stop at that location because it's so good at home. The service was terrible, the food was worse. Our order was wrong all the way across the board, I got an attitude when I asked for it to be fixed. The beans were so old they were crusted on top and the rice was stale. The woman cooking the food had her phone propped against the wall video calling someone while cooking while the other had her phone in her back pocket with an earbud running to her ear, the third stood on the corner scooping sauce out of a bucket she had her foot on into cups while people stood at the counter waiting to be served.

"Disappointed 8 months preggo here reporting that I received only part of my order. I had a craving for tacos and nachos so I thought why not give Fuzzy's a try. I ordered shredded chicken nachos, a taco plate and a tempura shrimp taco via Uber Eats. When I received my food, I thought the delivery person forgot to give me a second bag because all that was in it was the nachos which had minimal chicken or toppings on them and a side of queso. Upon looking at the receipt, it showed 1 of 1 meaning there wasn't a second bag. Thankfully, I was able to partially get a refund but now I'm left hungry and needing to place an order elsewhere.",-0.4051

It was 5:45 pm and they were completely out of Salsa. I asked how long it would take to make and they said about 20 min. I asked to substitute guacamole and the counter girl said they couldn't do that. I asked to speak to manager and wanted to have the guacamole since they were not prepared and she said they can't do that since they always charge extra $2.00 for guacamole. They are unwilling to make the customer satisfied. They were not prepared at dinner time with hot food or salsa, a main ingredient at a Mexican place, and they were not accommodating or willing to make the customer happy. Will not be back. They need a new manager.",-0.2378

"One of the worst take-out experiences. Loved this place and would always recommend. Today we went to go pick up an order that we had placed 4 days earlier to celebrate Cinco De Mayo. When we pull onto the street there was a back up of cars and 30 people outside of the restaurant. We placed our order to be picked up for 6:00 pm. We didn't leave until 7:45 because they absolutely bit off more than they could chew. There was no leader, no communication for long periods of time from employee to customers. I asked several times for my order and they said they didn't have it. Someone finally asked if it was a taco pack and she went and grabbed it from the cooler. I expected my food to be cold already because of the ordering instructions online. But they had no separate table for such pre ordered cinco de Mayo kits. Employees weren't clear with how things were being handled. They did have a separate section for food and food with alcohol but they should have had a third section with someone grabbing the taco kits that were preordered. They never had one employee standing up front at all times, they all went to the back and it was a huge mess. They should have had just one or two people up at the counter at all times and have a runner or walkie talkies to communicate to the back of the house. Then when we got the food home the portions were supposed to be for 4 people and they were terrible portions. It's a shame this had to happen. Won't be going back for a very long time.",-0.9232
"Ordered from Uber eats - was super excited to get a Cali burrito in Tampa. I'm not sure if something in the burrito was spoiled or if they fried the French fries in the same oil as the fish but I couldn't stomach more than 2 bites.

I went against my better judgment of knowing I've never had a decent taco from this chain across the U.S. They served me an old dried out quesalupa! Almost $4  for this??? Cheese crust hard as cement all the way around it. That wasn't bubbling from melting that was some scratch your throat and tongue nastiness I wouldn't serve a dog.

"Ok, so after my last negative review I thought it only fair to allow this establishment, that I frequent, another chance to redeem themselves. I must say that I am so upset and utterly disappointed that I did. We ordered through Chipotle's App and it was said that our order would be ready at 7:50pm (I am writing this at 8:20). As we stand here they said that their currently fulfilling orders for 7:20pm! 

The staff and the management never apologized nor acknowledged the fact that we are standing here waiting FOREVER! It is. It is not lost on me that staffing shortages happen, but courtesy and customer service doesn't have to go missing. I am writing this review as I stand here waiting. No offer of a discount or even some water while we wait. There was ZERO delay in charging my card for the food. 

We were told that If we want to complain then we can go online (still no apology for the wait). This Chipotle was one of superior customer service and over the last two months it has become one of the worst customer service experiences ever!!! This redemption opportunity is a waste!! 

I wish I could give a food review of this eatery but there is no food to review. I am at a loss and please believe corporate will be hearing about this (hope to post a positive update after speaking to them). UNACCEPTABLE!! (Review ended at 8:37; still waiting)",-0.9216

I also liked their salsa and chips. I went to the downtown store for lunch today. And I wonder if it has new owners or something. They were under staffed. The fancy coke machine was out of over half the flavors. No diet at all. I told them and she looked at it, poked a few buttons, and said I could have some water. Also they now serve tasteless black beans and a practicaly white rice with a few peas and carrots in it. Also tasteless. Tacos were ok, but with everything  the cheap steak issue was now magnified. I now know why they were empty. Sad loss.",-0.3716
"Absolutely awful service. They had to completely remake my quesadilla because they made it wrong, and dropped my dad's quesadilla. Every ingredient was not stocked and were being scraped from the bottoms of the containers. 

The customer service was nonexistent. We were not greeted, and were not talked to unless it was to clarify what we said. They simply stared until we started talking.

The ice machine was out of ice. There were only 2 kinds of salsa at the salsa bar.

I ordered through Ubereats and by the time I got there it was ready and closed so I didn't wanna open it but when I get home I open my food I realize that my Carne Asada salad was basically vegetarian salad.

Rolled her eyes and was just as surly as  ever. We ordered two margaritas and she promptly refilled obviously inebriated patrons and overlooked us. Luisa did not care one iota.

We did show the employee on duty who brought it back to the kitchen and then back to our table saying that it's how we make them here at Fuzzy's. It was barely the width of my palm. Maybe 4"".

"What a complete SHIT SHOW!!! THe ONLY good thing that came of the night was our Bartender Ashley with the Smiley face baseball cap on. She single handedly ran the bar, getting ice as needed with at least 5 others standing around being completely useless. The bathroom... that was interesting, not sure how you can have a restaurant staffed to that Capacity with hardly anyone in it and  have staff members standing around doing nothing when the bathrooms are not being taken care of. Kitchen staff... y'all are the real MVP's cause although the staff was useless, food was on point. I rarely write reviews but tonight was so disheartening and so disappointed especially in these trying times.

"Terrible customer service and terrible food. I order 2 chalupas, and one quesadilla. Originally they forgot my sauce and I had to go back thru the line only to still be handed the wrong sauce at the window. The food was TERRIBLE, it looked like it was sitting for a while and was cold.",-0.8918

They are serving undercook food
I ask for the manager today at 5:51 pm and they told me is in the office .
They had only 2 people on the line

I'm a big taco fan and I like to try them everywhere & Fuzzy's is by the worst taco I've ever had. Veggies tasted old, the flavors just weren't right & this is the second chance I gave Fuzzy's and will absolutely be the last. I have no idea how this chain exists with the terrible flavors and the depressed lack luster food. You shouldn't legally be able to call these tacos, they sad.",-0.8335

There was some at the bar washing glasses and there seemed to be some in tge back in front of the kitchen just playing on his phone. Some other people came in behind me and finally he got off his phone to come take orders,  but I was already tired of waiting and was already out the door. Maybe i should have waited longer, but was too hungry and felt like this place wasn't very organized and would take too long for food.",-0.1548

Oh, no salsa. Dry. So disappointed. Can't say it enough.",-0.946

Their menu has shrunk and shrunk and shrunk and now the only vegetarian option is a bean and rice burrito. That does not include anything like grilled vegetables. They do not have chili Reanos 's. They do not have shrimp they do not have fish. Their menu it's so small at this point I will not go back. What a ridiculous thing to have a huge shame that used to have so many different things to eliminate all of them. You might as well go to a shopping mall. Seriously shopping mall!!",-0.772

"When checking my order, I noticed that 4 items were missing out of the 6 I ordered. When I brought this up, the person on the make line came around and said ""how is that possible"" and proceeded to snatch the bag out of my hand very abruptly. After I was given the rest of the food I got home and went to eat my food. On my triplelupa, only one of the three had meat in it at all. I have a picture of that. My husbands triplelupa was so burnt he could not even bite into it. The taco fell apart the second I opened the paper and I was unable to eat that as well. Ultimately, I had to go somewhere else to get dinner because all of my food was unedible and I knew that the staff would not be helpful if I can back to have it fixed. I have been to this Taco Bell many times and have always dealt with its inconsistent and often rude service. After this experience I doubt I will be going back.",-0.5764

"Zero stars!!!! This place is a disgrace! Dorian (the supposed manager) takes no responsibility for his poor team and is completely irresponsible. We ordered 4 meals with chicken, they took our order and we read it back. We get to the window and pay nearly $40. They give us 3 tacos and two drinks and try to send us on our way. When questioning our order, they tell us to pull to the front bc they made a mistake. We wait for nearly 20mins and they don't come out. After knocking on the door, a girl in a bonnet answered saying they don't have any chicken. We ask why wouldn't they come and tell us before waiting, they responded ""we didn't know and the lady taking the orders is old and should not be working nights "" Don't really know what that has to do with anything but regardless no apologies were made. After asking for a refund, we mentioned it's just common courtesy to let people know their order can't be completed bc the establishment doesn't have the necessary products instead of waiting 20 mins first. All in all this place is messed up and wrong and unapologetic! DONT GO HERE! This place is trash and had roaches when the girl opened the door! Be careful!",-0.9327
"Went to Moe's after we left the theatre nearby. Ordered a steak bowl with chips and salad. Well don't know who owns this place or who traIns these gentlemen working there,, but the way they built our burritos and bowls was disappointing. They actually only put five pieces of cubed steak in my bowl. Literally fIve small pieces of steak. I complained and stated the other Moes in WiregRass sErves you an abundance of meat. They gave me more steak and thhen charged me for it unknowingly. I sat down reviewed my seat and saw the extra charge. Went back and they took it off but I found that to be scrupulous.  Was not satisfied with how the burritos were built and how stingy they arre with the ingredients.  If you want Moes, go to the one in wiregrass, they know how to build burrItos tHere.",-0.9377

"Went in with family mind you yes we are traveling from CA. The chicken was boiled and tasted days old. The cheese in my burrito gave off a could sour taste, and the carne asada had a slimy texture to it. I took two bites in my burrito and spit it out. The tacos look sad with a tortilla that just went from the bag to the plate. Overall very disappointing. This place should not sell food.",-0.5984
"Went in to pick up an online order after work. The order was set for 6:30 I came in at 7 and didn't see it on the shelf. I asked a worker and she ended up having to remake it. My order was passed between several workers and left on the table for several minutes and nobody seemed to know what it was. When I the order was finally ""ready"" a burrito was missing as were the sides. The burrito was made with only the toppings, no bases (meat,rice etc.) when I asked what was in it she admitted it was just the toppings. I told  her to remake it because it was totally wrong. She did but it did take a little argument. I won't be ordering again, this isn't the first time I have had an issue.",-0.719
"Last time I was there I was served a soda from a line that contained some sort of backed up sewage.  It was disgustIng. The manager was apologetic and the staff were very professional.  They handled the situation well and kudos to the staff, but that doesn't change the fact that I drank a mouth full of  sewage that was supposed to be soda.  ‍  Please make sure nobody else gets sick.  


I went back on several occasions. Twice we were served veggies that were expired.  Somebody in management needs to fix this restaurant. They are definitely getting people sick.",-0.012
"I feel like I got robbed by Taco Bell for my money after this meal. One of my worst experiences at Taco Bell ever. The wait was extremely long for only 2 cars in front of me. The food I received was smashed and looks like it was thrown together with the least amount of care they could possibly manage. Everything I opened up ended up falling apart. There is a certain need for even distribution of toppings in burritos and tacos and everything was just stuffed in with no care. All the sour cream on one side, Guac all piled up on the bottom and falling out. Paid 5$ for a xxl stuffed burrito that wasn't worth a nickel. Just complete garbage work by the entire staff. And I got attitude when I handed back the drink that tasted horrible. Sorry I wanted something to be acceptable in this disaster meal they just served us. I will not be returning anytime soon. I don't normally give very low 1 star ratings, so when you get one you know you've EARNED IT!!",-0.7386

"We were visiting our daughter at USF and decided to give this place a try. We were very disappointed with the food and lack of service.

First of all, you basically order your own food through an app. So if you have any questions you have to place a card up on your table and wait for someone to see it and come around. 

I ordered a Paloma cocktail and it was pretty awful. The best part was the salt on the rim. That's pretty sad! The chips and salsa we ordered were not brought out before our entrees. As a matter of fact I had to stop to waiters to ask about the chips. They finally brought it AFTER we had all eaten our meal. I will say, at least they did not charge us for them.

We ordered an assortment of tacos and were not impressed. They were actually pretty plain tasting. The shrimp taco was awful. The shrimp was over cooked and chewy. For the price of each taco you'd expect more toppings in your taco besides cilantro and onions.

I am sad to say, that We will definitely not be coming back. We had high hopes.",-0.3693
"Im assuming the circumstances because of poor management. Its 8pm and it closes at 9pm, people are sitting down but we are told by staff we cant sit down even though I paid and tipped during the open hours.

Staff was rude and should focus on providing an amazing experience.",-0.5272
"The chips and salsa were ok.    That is where it all goes down hill.    The food was terrible.   The chili rellenos were made with some cheese sauce that tasted like velveeta, the tacos were worse than taco bell, just terrible all around.    So I decide I will tell the waitress that we were pretty unhappy with the food - her response - well, I'm not the cook.    Wow.   To top it all off, this is not reasonably priced mexican.",-0.6566

"If there was less than a star I would have to give them zero stars. I walk in and there was a new young man at the counter.  Total deer in head lights type of thing but he quickly looked for help. The cutest lil Asian girl comes to assist. As I approach the counter to begin my order I noticed all of the food looks old and reheated. Red flag.  I was starving so my exact words were,  can you stir up the meat so I can get some from the bottom. I continued down the line.  I asked for a side item and here pops out this big guy with sunglasses or transition lens that did not allow me to see his eyes whispering in the girl's ear. I think ok, what did I miss. Oh......the upcharge for queso! No problem.  We continued down the line questioning the freshness and quality of the food but again I was about to pass out. We make it to the register and and here comes the mystery man with the whisper.....upcharge! Got it.   I was like ok let me get to this meal. I paid about 15 bucks for my plate of nachos and noticed there was no breakdown of charges or the additional up charges on my receipt so in actually I don't know what I paid for.  My companion and I go to get a drink and the machine is completely broken.  At this point I am really kicking myself for not going elsewhere and thinking WERE WE THE FIRST CUSTOMERS OF THE DAY AND NONE OF THE FOOD WAS FRESH. (SMH as I post this). I look at my food and make the sign of the cross and dig in. I HAVE HAD BETTER LEFTOVERS RIGHT OUT OF THE FRIDGE THAN WHAT I WAS SERVED. Everything was cold......everything.....meat, beans, queso!!! It was as if I had Mexican pulled out of the fridge 3 days later. I couldn't eat it. So now I want to wash this down and still no drink. There were 5 to 6 people with empty cups waiting for the machine to be reloaded with some cartridge for proper use. As I looked around I see it is very unsanitary and just disgusting.  As I am walking out the door, you would think you were walking out of a mechanic shop or something it was just so filthy. Sooooo filthy.  I dare anyone to visit and look at the inside of the door and ask yourself if you could actually eat there. There was another person on staff. A woman with short hair. If she or the guy with the sunglasses are the managers not sure what they are managing because it is definitely not this joint.",-0.7531

The staff here can't keep up and seems to get overwhelmed with the workload during busy times, like Taco Tuesday around dinner time.

It is possible that I may never have gotten my entire to-go order. This afternoon my husband asked for sauce and was told that sauce was already in the bag. It wasn't. He even checked through the bag quickly, assuming sauce might be under the napkins. At least we weren't missing multiple items when we got home this time, only one bean burrito. The rancid oil taste was so strong that the cinnamon twists were inedible. No one expects Taco Bell to be a fine dining experience. The price they charge for the quality of food you receive is too high, the price you pay for the food they don't even put into the bag is outrageous.",-0.5824

We sat outside, inside smelled really bad almost like mop water & you could smell it even sitting outside. My strawberry mojito was literally strawberry flavored water, I ended up not drinking it and ordering a beer that came out luke warm. The steak nachos I ordered tasted like they were made 2 weeks ago. The waitress saw that I wasn't happy, didn't ask how anything was, gave no fucks and just kept doing whatever she was doing. To top it off, there was a lady that came with her dog to have a drink outside and everyone who worked in the restaurant kept coming out to play with the dog & let the dog jump all over them, then came to serve us our food and drinks with those same hands.

Im shocked i never have been here  in usa or any country in the world asking where visited some country id or passport even my id international, im so disappointed with the restaurant , Manager and the other waiters were really rude to us! i will never ever visit again , they were so rude and RACIST ... dont visit guys!

We came with a church group so there was 12 of us. The restaurant would only take cash, (the credit machine was broken) so we had to go to the cash station. They were out of tea, sweet or plain. Out of sprite or 7up. Took forever to order, forever to get food...everyone got food but my husband and I because they gave it to the wrong person. So we waited while everyone else ate. After a while ours had finally come. We had ordered just an appetizer of a shredded chicken quesadilla. After a few bites it just didn't seem to taste right. I opened it up to find a small shrimp. Thank God I am not allergic. When we received the check there was a $2 extra charge for the shrimp. My husband went up to question this with the manager. He asked the waitress about it and she said I ordered the shrimp. Everyone at the table knew what I ordered because most of us had the same thing. He REFUSED to take off the $2. Now, we were not asking for it for free, just wanting to pay for what I ordered. Will NEVER go there again!! Neither will anyone at our table. Two others had errors on their bill. There are plenty of other Mexican restaurants in the area to go to.",-0.285

And the chimichanga had no queso or sour cream 
And very little beef. But thankfully it was very little because the ground beef was comparing to a can food like dinty Moore or something.

"We went at around 9:30 expecting to have some decent food. And we'll the completely failed any expectations I had for them. The bowl and the tacos were so dry I had to take a sip of water just to get a single bite down. Not to mention the bowl absolutely had no flavor at all... the ceviche was eh, the fish had a weird taste to it nothing I've ever experienced at a restaurant before. The chips and salsa were great though that's the only thing I'd ever order from there again. So to try and brighten our night we got the tres leches dessert. The whipped cream was flavorless. The actual dessert tasted stale and old. It was a waste of money. If you plan on going to one of the worst taco places you've ever gone to and spending way to much go here.",-0.7698
"Horrible! I went last night and our server was horrible!!! Omg I'm never going back! Chips and the salsa had like a tablespoon on the cup (which tasted like marinada) I told her, she said be right back, she came, asked for our drinks... 10 mins passed and no drinks, she came again and asked our order, this time we added appetizer and drinks (for the second time we asked for drinks), 20 minutes later... nothing... another server asked if the order was taken, I said yes 3 times we asked for the drinks... 5 mins later the same server came and got the drinks (Pepsi was supposed to have a lime that never came), and appetizer... we ate and waited 20 mins for someone to take our order, no one came... so we got up and left! Do you think I left that nasty Server a tip?! Of course not! We paid like 10.97... no tip, we could have order actual food and probably pay 40-50 dollars. That server must be trained, cause if she treats customer that way, and they don't want to be waiting, they are going to lose tons of money!",-0.9098

"Service was good but food was terrible. I ordered a sampler platter and the rest of the table ordered burgers. The food was slightly over cooked and came out cold. Bottomless mimosas were terrible and not drinkable. I wouldn't return to this restaurant unless to see the drag show.",-0.8658
"Have been eating at Valarta's for years and this was the worst experience I have had, The waiter was rude and had to have our order repeated 3 times. Once food was delivered did not check back again till we were done. Ran out of chips and drink which he saw but never ask to refill. Will have to make sure this location is off the list of Valertas. I can see why it was empty for lunch with this type of service.",-0.4215
"In town on biz and went here with a co-worker. I ordered nachos and was NOT impressed at all. The ingredients were  as follows:
Ground beef -- no spices whatsoever, and literally tasted worse than taco bell meat. 
Shredded chicken -- tasted freezer burned, had little spices, and was very bland. 
Cheese -- what cheese?? there was some kind of white cheese SAUCE, but no cheese. Because of this SAUCE the chips got soft and slimy quick. 
Refried beans -- there might have been some on there but very hard to tell with how wet everything was.
Chips -- same chips as what came with the salsa. The chips were tasty, possibly homemade, possibly store-bought and re-dipped in a fryer, etc, but good nonetheless. The salsa was not much more than a cheap ketchup-based product like Pace.
Lettuce -- shredded iceberg lettuce everywhere, a bit overdone, and hid most of the chips and other ingredients.

My co-worker from Texas ordered a chicken mole-looking concoction and barely ate any of it as he said it tasted bad. Only after work did I see one of the recent reviews where someone stated he and his wife got food poisoning --- now I'm worried we'll both have problems. LOL

I would avoid this place and try somewhere else -- way too many choices to bother going here.",-0.9614
"I've been to Mary's many times for Drag Queen Bingo and everything was always fine.  However, do not, I repeat, do not go on Saturday night for the Drag show.  When we made the reservation they told us if we weren't there before 7 they would give away our seats.  So we were there early only to wait outside for almost half an hour before they let us in, after 7 btw.  Our polite party of four was even yelled for standing off to the side.

Once we were finally seated, our waiter came to the table right away and brought water.  We didn't see him again for another fifteen minutes.  We finally ordered and he forgot my drink when everyone else's arrived.  I also had been out of water for five minutes; I continued to be for a while.

So the food arrives and there is still no silverware.  It's really hard to eat without it.  I still have no adult beverage or water.  One of the other ladies in my party had to get up and track down silverware for us after we sat there waiting for it. 

The food was not good.  The chicken was overcooked; the bacon was cooked to the point it was inedible; the avocado was over ripe.  No one else was impressed with their food or mixed drinks.  The waiter finally comes to check on us and I get my water and beverage.  I should have ordered two.

The drag show finally starts and our seats are terrible.  I can't even see where the stage is much less anything that's going on.  To add insult to injury, the waiter never came back for more drinks and you're not even allowed to get up during the show so if you have to go to the bathroom you're screwed.  So instead of watching the show I waited so long to see, I sat here looking at the wall, having to pee, wishing I had wine, and getting to write this.  After more than 90 minutes of the show, I maybe saw two minutes worth of pathetic partial glimpses of drag queens, most of which was from the side or behind of them posing with someone across the room.  I wish I would have stayed home everything was so bad.  To make it even worse, when I finally got to use the restroom, only two of the four stalls in the ladies room closed and locked.

The only even remotely positive thing about the night was my company I came with.  Unfortunately, I can still say that I have never seen a drag show.  :(",-0.9771
"I've been to a lot of drag shows and this was the worst one yet. The drag queens spent 1 second on stage and the rest of the time circling the restaurant gathering $. The restaurant is big so the majority of the time you're watching the drag queens on the other side of the restaurant or on crappy tvs. We went for a show and never got one. Pretty bad...",-0.9328

"Do NOT stop, do not even try it, JUST pass it and go someplace else!!!!!

This has to be the worst tasting, most rip off Mexican restaurant I have ever been to. We stopped here because there is a great big sign outside that says 2-1 Margaritas and free Nachos Grande. Our waitress said the special is only Mon-Fri even tho sign states Sat-Sun all day and that the nachos are not free unless you buy 4 margaritas???? 
I had to ask her to go outside and read the sign, then the nachos arrive and it looked like a dog threw up on the plate. They were 15 soggy chips covered in watery beans, mystery meat and watery cheese. 

We had ordered the Beef Fajitas with extra meat as 3 of us were sharing them. What arrived was a plate of veggies with a little bit of meat on the top. 

When we complained about paying an extra 8.00 on TOP of the already pricy 17.00 the first woman shrugged her shoulders, we complained again and a woman came out of kitchen refused to credit anything off our bill and only offered to make us more food???

HERE IS A HINT OWNERS: if a customer dislikes your food why in gods name would you force them to take more instead of doing the right thing and crediting the bill??? Oh and I have NEVER had a Mexican place tell me they do not have any jalapenos??? It cost us 58.00 for 3 of us to be upset and feel ripped off  and that they DO NOT care about customers at all. 

I will never ever eat at your place ever again, you serve tasteless dog food nachos and nasty excuse for fajitas! Plus your prices weren't lower than 9.00 for anything on menu! You get a negative 5 stars from this Food Critic!",-0.5785
"This place was terrible!!!  For starters, the salsa was horrible... It didn't taste homemade and quite frankly tasted like salsa one buys at the store.  Very unsat for a Mexican restaurant.  How about some authentic homemade salsa... Don't give out Pace Salsa... Keep it real.  The entree was no better... The carne asada was terrible and the worst I have ever tasted at a ""Mexican"" restaurant.  Steak tacos at Taco Bell blow this place away at a fraction of the cost... Chipotle or Del Taco chains also blow this place away at a fraction of the cost.  Huge disappointment and not recommended.  Nearby Tijuana Flats was a whole lot better... and a whole lot cheaper.",-0.9217
"Horrible service, bland food. We waited forever to see a waitress, and then she didn't have much time for us. We had to point out to her that we were out of chips and salsa. The place wasn't nearly full, either. When the food came, it had little taste, especially the burritos. We won't be back.",-0.5423
"The lunch we had was really bad. The chicken was not fresh, it tasted like it was made several days ago. The chicken was so dry and tasteless I couldn't eat it. They need a lesson on cutting up onions and peppers, there where large have cut pieces of them everywhere.",-0.7055
"After seeing the Undercover Boss episode on Hamburger Mary's, my wife and I received a Groupon offer and decided to give it a try. We accidentally ended up there for lunch on Saturday. The server was dull - did not offer drink specials or highlights of the menu, didn't ask anything other than if we wanted to sit inside or outside. As this was a hamburger place, I ordered a hamburger. The hamburger tasted like a frozen burger. Was served on a basic bun. Fries were not fresh. The atmosphere was dull. The server had no personality. None of the bartenders even looked up. Nothing about the place said LGBTQ+ atmosphere. We were disappointed to say the least. Will not be returning.",-0.8901
"I chose this restaurant based on the 4 star rating. Or experience was far less than a 4. It was seat yourself so we chose a table. Hear is where the bad experience started and never ended. We sat for 20 minutes before a waitress came over. Another 10 minutes before we were asked if we wanted drinks, another 10 to ask if we wanted food and after we finally ordered, another 45 minutes before we received our Cuban sandwiches. At no point did the waitress communicate why it was taking so long, nor did she ever ask us if the food was good or if we wanted another drink. Worst experience ever and I will never come back. Last note,  there were only about 20 other people in the restaurant and several of them got up and left before they were approached.",-0.7845
"When this location opened I decided to try the fish tacos which came with tortilla chips a few weeks ago.
I was very disappointed!
The shell fell apart and the slaw wss horrible!
Long John Silvers fish tacos are a thousand times better!
The tortilla chips were thick and had a horrible after taste.
My first and last time!",-0.7623
"Absolutely horrible. I ordered queso and was brought the cheese that was clearly the cheese they put on everything else just melted. And they charged $6 for this so called queso. My group and I were involuntarily charged 20% gratuity for shitty service and shitty food. Never going back bye.",-0.8977
"I am big on Burgers... not at all impressed.

The place was nothing like I expected. The decorations made it seem so corporate. The place is huge, brightly colored. There is so much seating - although full due to Friday night reservations. I found my way to the bar. 

Bartender had a bit of an attitude. Stared at me and waited for me to order shortly after handing me a beverage list. My boyfriend became uneasy and ordered something he did not want. I sat there and made him wait - ordered a House Margarita. He still got his 20%. Maybe that will make him smile a little.

I felt like I was going into diabetic shock. Drink was extremely sweet. Although the boyfriend did say his was heavily poured. I wanted an appetizer but the selection was horrible. I just wanted to able to  eat the burger that was coming afterwards and was looking for a half-way lighter choice which I did not find in their selection of mac and cheese, sliders, spinach and artichoke, loaded potato chips, and so on. I ordered a Buffy, he ordered the Spicy Mary, we opted for the buffalo patties.  He asked me how I wanted it cooked, I said medium rare which was irrelevant because it came out very well done. I am not one to complain, I ate it - well most of it. The buffalo pattie  was extremely dry.  The only thing that made the sandwich was the potato bun. The jalapenos on his burger were pickled and not very nice looking. 

I ate the fries. 

Caught a bit of the drag show. That was nice. That is the only allure to the place.  The food is nothing to brag about. 

$70 later... I left.

Never going back.",-0.7355

"As like all the other recent reviews in the past couple months, this location recently is the worst Moe's experience I've ever had. All I wanted was a salad. I asked the guy making it what usually comes on it, his response was, I don't know, I just started a week ago. So I just told him what I wanted on it, then before he put the lid on it, I had to tell him the dressing was supposed to go on it.

At the register, the customers 2 ahead of me returned because they forgot to give them a whole bag of their food. He did not know how to use a gift card for the person directly in front of me, and he had to get help. I gave him my credit card, and as he was scanning it, he said, you can put a tip on it, a tip would be nice. Then I had to ask for a bag for my to go order, which took him at least 2 minutes to get the bag and put my food in it.

I understand hiring young people, but there needs to be a qualified person overseeing them. And I would expect a little more training so these people have a clue of what they are doing. The salad was half the size it should be. The restaurant looked dirty. I frequently visit this location, and it has gone drastically downhill.",-0.0387
"I used to visit this place almost every week, and although I thought the food was decent (not great) I finally grew tired of the slow service, the dirty environment, and the extremely loud mariachi duo that strolls the restaurant on weekend nights (one guy even wears an amplifier on his belt!).  So instead of eating here, I drive several miles into Tampa to my favorite Mexican restaurant.  Maybe someday Brandon will have a quality Mexican restaurant, but for now all we seem to have are the barely-better-than-fast-food ones.",-0.2942
"My family and I tried this place for take out after reading all of the positive reviews. We were completely disappointed. We waited about 25 minutes for our meal, which was a tad bit lengthy while sitting with 2 young children, but in anticipation of our meal, it wasn't a big deal.  We ordered a couple of menu items including a black bean and rice with chicken dinner. This tasted no better than your average buffet meal. The chicken was rubbery and there was absolutely no flavor to the meat, rice or beans. What a let down. My wife and I looked at each other as if we just got scammed by fake yelp reviewers. Maybe there was a new and inexperienced cook that evening, but either way, we won't be going back.",-0.6365

Don't remember what it was but it tasted skanky. I like beer and this wasn't just ""not to my taste"" -- it was off and didn't taste fresh. We ordered the pretzels and that was served chopped up. It was sort of dried out and pretty mediocre. A group of people were turned away when they asked if they could watch a boxing match, even though the bar wasn't crowded and no one seemed to be watching any of the games they were showing. There are way better places to get a good beer in Ybor -- James Joyce, Tampa Bay Brewing Co., King Corona, The Bad Monkey, etc. Avoid this place. We won't be back.",-0.0188

"A roach crawled down the wall and jumped onto the table next to us. What was more shocking was when the staff tried to explain ""it was only a palmetto bug and we shouldn't worry.""  Didn't try to disagree with such a genius, just wanted to pay the bill and leave. 

Highly regret coming here. It's always been subpar but it was the only Mexican restaruant open until 11 in the vicinity and we decided to give it another try. Big mistake. Salsa is basically pizza sauce, beans are out of a can, and my shrimp weren't even deveined. Was willing to look past it all and chalk it up to a ""meh"" dinner when the roach popped in to say hi.

So bad I just didn't even want to eat anything else. The salsa came with the chips tasted weird too. The queso with the chips was ok. I apologized to the waitress for complaining but I thought they tasted horrible. Almost like the meat was bad or something. She took the tacos away then came back with them telling me the chef said it was because I added cheese and it was throwing the flavor off. Almost like arguing with me. I was so surprised. I only had 2 bites and wasn't like I was trying to get a free meal or anything. I offered to still pay for them because I felt bad. But I always get my tacos with cheese no matter what Mexican place I eat at and they have always been fine. Ugh. They ended not charging me for the tacos but still changed me for the extra cheese that I never got to even eat. Lol. I won't be going back there.",-0.9523

"I visit this location whenever I am in town and lately is been a disappointment. On Mondays they have ""Drag Bingo and Kareoke"".I took some of my friends 2 Mondays ago which some were visiting from out of town. First of all you have to wait for the hostess to seat you for approx. 15 minutes (which he or she was never seeing). Then had to grab a server to seat us because no one acknowledge us. Second of all I have to ask for menus  after nearly been seated for 5 minutes. I understand they are packed and short staff. Then they did not want to serve my friend a drink because of no ID. No big deal she usually goes there every other Monday so the server that usually serves on her  confirmed age. Even though her age was verified the server states that their rule is not to serve alcohol without ID. Ok we can live with that but the drink order took forever, and my friend decided to switch tables with the server that always takes care of her. Then, the manager comes with a nasty attitude stating that he is no longer on the floor that what can he help us with. We asked to be seated outside because their speaker was on top of us. Feels annoying trying to eat, drink and listening to horrible singers. It's kind of too loud. Then the manager continues with an attitude refusing to seat us outside basically saying ""it is what it is"" ending leaving the place and go eat somewhere else. As a gay community supporter I suggest the owners to take a look closer of their management, staffing and customer service. No wonder why gay places or bars never make it because they become rude and prejudice with their own people. With that been said they lost me and my friends as customers.",-0.9469
"Estelas has gone down hill since I last visited a few years back. This past Friday a group of friends and I stopped by and  we ignored the Puke Palace Review since we were only getting drinks. Mistake! I ordered a Key Lime margarita expecting it to made with limes. Any limes would do but they served me a bright Slimer Green drink that tasted like Jolly Ranchers. The other margaritas were equally as bad. The bathrooms were gross, blood was on the wall and toilet. Stay away until this place gets their act together.",-0.1511

I cut into the burrito and there was sour cream and no Jalapenos. I called to complain and the lady told me she would remember me and would take care of me the next time I came into the restaurant. I come back the following week, and they not only charge me for the new burrito, but told me that this time there is no sour cream and that they added Jalapeno's into my burrito and gave me extra on the side. This was a lie as I get back to the office, and find there is no Jalapeno's inside my burrito, only the ones they gave me on the side. This time I send an email, and no response from the restaurant. Customer service at this place is horrible along with attention to detail. I don't plan to return as they can't seem to get an order correct.

"Stopped in for lunch today and I must say this will be the last time I will be eating there.  My wife and my 16 month old son went there because we had eaten there on a previous occasion and it was ok.  The food was awful, absolutely horrible. We had the nachos supreme as an appetizer which was disgusting.  It was just a pile of stale chips covered in a nasty processed cheese sauce with a bunch of shredded lettuce.  The taco salad I had was nasty as well.  The worst part of the whole meal were the tamales which were dreadful.  I am almost certain that they were frozen and just thrown in a microwave and they were smothered in a disgusting beef meat sauce.  We had to complain about them because they were that bad.  The server took them off the bill but the manager never came by to inquire about the quality of the food.  My guess is he knew how awful it was and was embarrassed.  This restaurant has to do better, how disrespectful to the country of Mexico and to the restaurant industry to serve such garbage.  Shame on you.",-0.9701

They served us KETCHUP and said it was salsa, and some moron next to us was talking about how much he loved it, we did watch him down 2 giant margarita's.  If I could give it 0 stars I would.  Imagine getting a burnt appetizer, and the waitress asking if we really wanted to send it back.  They made substitutions on my meal without telling me because they were out of tortillas.  They bought bulk crunchy taco shells, and then fried them.  Mine was stale, and so was the tostada shell.  My wife got a chimichanga which was not fried, filled with burnt hamburger meat and then had a disgusting cheese and jalapeno sauce pored over it.  We didn't finish and left.

I got charged $11.99 for the michelada wich the size was like pretty much the normal size glass wherever you go. The server said that there were 2 beers in the glass (wich I doubted it) and the was the reason it was $11.99. She said the total amount was $37.00 wich I paid cash and later when I checked the receipt it was $32.00... I dont mind paying money but I guess they have to make things very clear from the very beginning. A total disappointment experience.",-0.2372

Asked for ground beef instead of shredded beef in my burrito and got shredded, which I hate.  Waitress had no idea what was on the menu. Chalupa was a soggy corn circle covered in beans that tasted like dirt. Son ordered fajitas that came out on a plate all dried up looking. It wasn't even sizzling!!!The chicken was dry and tasteless. We're watching plate after plate be returned to the kitchen. This place is awful. I will never eat here again. I don't recommend that you send your worst enemy here.

"Very displeased with the restaurant overall. The beer selection was extensive and seemed to be reasonably priced, however the food was a different story. It didn't start well as the server seemed to have forgotten about us at our table as we waited to order our entres. The menu seemed nice and simple but when we tried to order directly off of the menu (nothing special) the server replied, ""okay I'll check to see if we have that, it's a new menu that we've only been using for a couple of weeks so we may not have everything"". Maybe ok overthinking this but regardless of whether the menu was new as of yesterday or 3 months ago, why would you even list it on the menu of you weren't going to keep it in stock? As we received our food, we were in shock as to how small the portions were. The $10 Quinoa Power Bowl was the size of a side-salad and you were hard pressed to find much (if any) quinoa, the sandwiches were far too small, and the actual side-salad was just a wedge of head lettuce cut in half with a couple of tomatoes and bacon bits sprinkled on top. Extremely disappointed and we all left hungry.",-0.7872

Our waiter took our drink orders which mostly consisted of fancy named frozen house drinks. By the way when we arrived was about 1.5 hrs BEFORE show...Finally waiter showed up way later to take our food orders which where mostly over priced appetizers. I was first but wasn't ready so he took everyone elses and walked off. I had to get up and place my order across the room because i knew he would not come back for a long time.. The drinks were horrible $9 for nasty chemical laden frozen mix with VERY LITTLE IF ANY ALCOHOL. MAJOR RIP OFF. So show starts can't see big posts. Stuff all over counter of floor bar in way and we are sitting on STOOLS!  My appetizer comes out 20 minutes before anybody elses!! Oh and did i mention when we STILL did not have any silverware on table!!! I finally went over to the matching large table which is still vacant and fully set with SILVERWARE!! And collect and give to our party so they can eat their food which is by now sitting there and waiter has diappeared AGAIN!  I quietly go up to talk to manager who is also seating people. I explain that I am Very Upset with silverware fiasco (i didn't even get into anything else)   BUT HIS SARCASTIC AND RUDE RESPONSE was the match that lit me up!  Well its not the waiters fault we don't always have enough silverware.....SERIOUSLY!!! not im so sorry that happened... I was so mad. If i hadn't been with a group.... I explained that i had a brother who went to CIA and was voted manager of the year at the highly acclaimed restaurant S.N.O.B.S in downtown historic Charleston.  And. Gritted my teeth

"The free salsa and fresh warm chips were refreshing however the tacos fell short. For $1 tacos, I was not expecting a 5 star spread, but these tacos were flavorless and underwhelming.

"I had always been a huge supporter of Estella's for about 10 years. That all ended when my wife and I went for an early dinner on Monday evening. 

Having been a regular for years we sort of had a routine of chips and queso, salsas (including the hotter on for me) followed by our meals which we would take most of home. 

This week was no different. The wife ordered her 2 tacos and I the #1 combo with beef. After filling up on the chips and salsa I wound up only having the taco there and brought the 2 burritos and rice home. As we left my wife wanted to go to the little ice cream shop down the street. 

No sooner had we gotten inside the ice cream shop and a bout of food poisoning stated up. It's now been over 40 hrs since the leaving the restaurant and the fever, stomach pain and other even more undesirable symptoms still exist. This is the worst bout of food poisoning I can ever remember having. I know for a fact that the poising came from the meal I/we ate at Estella's on Monday 3/26. My guess is the contaminated item on this visit was the spicy salsa since its the only thing I had which the wife did not.

Since reading some other reviews where others having repeatedly gotten food poising at multiple of their locations ...... I'll NEVER go again. I have had problems with about a dozen visits to Estella's over the last 10 years where I'd have immediate stomach issues thereafter but never really chalked it up the food quality or food poisoning for one reason or another. Looking back on it now, the last visit prior to this one also left myself and a coworker with food poisoning after having lunch at the location on S Dale Mabry. 

Now begins the search for the best Mexican place in the bay (any suggestions welcome).

"THIS is literally the biggest scam I've ever experienced. I haven't gone on yelp in years but I just had to see if anyone had written a review about this dump. Please read so you can hear about my shitty experience. First, the place from the outside looks sketchy like some rundown Taco Bell that was reopened into this dive Mexican place. When you walk inside, it's actually pretty. The waitress brought me the menu and already I'm thinking I'm in trouble. $8.99 for a lunch special and it's literally the shittiest options? 1 taco/1 enchilada, 1 sope/1 tamale, no burritos on the lunch menu or taco basket...so whatever I just asked for whatever I thought would be the most for my money. Then the sever informs me that it's $2 extra for weekend. Okay no. Let me fucking recalculate because there is no way in hell that I am going to pay $11 for a fucking enchilada and a taco. What i really was in the mood for was a wet burrito...however that was $13! Like what the shit Mexican food can not be that expensive?! Anyway I ordered that because everything on the menu is at least $11  I ordered a margarita and I felt skeptical about it because I saw their menu only had beer, wine and a margarita. Hmmm i think that means they don't have a liquor license and there is a pretty good chance they're serving some malt liquor beergarita bullshit.  Before ordering the marg I asked the server how it was made and she kind of played dumb and said ""with ice""  whatever I ordered it anyway like a dumbass and it was definitely not tequila. It was definitely some bullshit as I suspected. That was $6. So the food was OKAY I had a tummy ache all night like something rock hard was in my tumtum all night. Besides that this is where the real scam came into play. You have to pay upfront at the register, no big deal. She asked me how much I wanted to tip. My meal was around $20, I told her $3. She said ""no it has to be a percentage."" So I said ""okay 15% then."" And she said, ""no you have to tip me 18-20% that's the way our computer works."" OKAY WHAT?! I have worked in restaurants for 9 years and I have NEVER heard of that in my life. Why even ask me what I want to tip if you're going to mandate it?! Has anyone else experienced this or was it just me? I usually tip 15-20% it wasn't like I was stiffing her. Total garbage. Food sucked, drink sucked, service sucked. This place only gets 1 star because I have to leave something, but if it were up to me I'd give this place 5 flaming turds! Don't eat here unless you want to be ripped the fuck off. I'll never be",-0.9936
"I went to Hamburger Mary's as part of my bachelorette party weekend.  We made reservations the day that we were going and were informed on the phone that had we made our reservations earlier, we would have gotten better seats.  What we were NOT told before we arrived was that our seats were in a booth at the back of the restaurant and really far from the stage with tall tables between us and the stage show that would have been impossible for half our party to see even if we didn't have a massive number of people's backs and butts between us and it.  This was not obstructed view seating, this was seating in another county.  

I expressed our unhappiness with this and said that we could have arranged to have gone a different evening if we had been told that this was the case on the phone.  We were assured by the manager/host that the performers would come around to engage us and we wouldn't miss anything.  This was a lie.  

Oh the performers came around alright, but only to say the same tired lines over and over again and ask for tips for having their picture taken with the crowd.  The first person out on stage was the show's host who admitted that she was drunk and bored (something that was clearly evident from the moment she came on stage).  There were about a million birthdays that people were out for and the MC ran out of lines about 3 birthdays in.  

When she came to our table, we told her that I was getting married and we thought she'd be excited to have something new to say, but she threw some tired lines out.  I gave her a ton to work with (he's marrying me for my money, not the other way around, he's the bride, he's 14 years younger) - all things that seasoned performers would have had a field day with.  All this one could do was tell me that I needed to dump my fiancee and find someone else with money to support me.  Wow - no imagination.

I love drag shows and I had been looking forward to this one for weeks.  But after 

1) Eating some really disgusting food that was the entry fee into this fiasco (the coconut shrimp was served with a sauce that didn't go with shrimp and totally masked the coconut which was a blessing since it was a frozen product to begin with and the loaded tots were covered in nacho cheese sauce, not melted cheese as the menu said) and 

2) Having to track down our waiter on multiple occasions (if you're going to treat us like this, at least get us liquored up so we don't care - we couldn't manage to get more than one drink all night),

We were forced to come to the conclusion that the most entertainment we were going to get out of our evening was the bitchy waiter from another table who would often stop when we were looking for ours, and offer us a biting comment or two.  

We left halfway through the show with indigestion and and a bad taste in our mouths.  If you've been to good drag shows, don't go here - you'll be really disappointed.",-0.9158

"Hungry and weary after a Bucs game, Mark H assured me his old Tampa haunt could fix me, and fix me it did. I couldn't eat again for another day. The adorable dining room and Day of the Dead menus left no hint of what awaited my bowels. After asking the server which of a couple of dishes she would suggest, I ordered the Mojo Shrimp and the hugest margarita they had. She went to the bar and pulled down on an ICEE type lever filling the hugest margarita glass I had ever seen with the concoction and bringing it right over. Not as quickly, my dish emerged. It possessed a funny smell upon arrival, and the shrimp were butterflied for no apparent reason. Also, the tails were on - a peeve of mine. I picked thru the hot dish de-tailing the tiny scattered shrimp while I considered asking if they could up charge me whatever amount to serve the shrimp correctly, but I was so hungry I pressed on. They were salty and really fishy, like say bad shrimp. I continued on with a silent smile as I politely  finished my plate. Mark was distracted by his Molcajete, and after a sniff of my dish, realized something was terribly wrong, but it was too late. I left after only a few sips of enormous margarita and reported directly to the restroom using my last remaining strength to build myself a nest in front of the bowl where I hung out for the next day.

"Got violently ill (uncontrollable non stop vomiting and diahrea) from food poisoning for two days straight after ordering a beer and some chips and queso here. My girlfriend also ate some of the chips and queso but drank wine and was fine, so I can only assume it was the beer/dirty tap lines. Which ironically was on special for really cheap.  When I asked the waitress why that particular beer was so cheap (a higher end beer I've had before and know typically sells for A LOT more) she snapped rudely at me ""because it tastes like shit"".  As someone who is somewhat of a craft beer aficionado, it was obvious she didn't know what she was talking about and probably shouldn't be working in a ""tap house"" that supposedly specializes in craft beer.  The waitress had an overall very bitchy attitude in general, like it was an inconvenience to wait on us and was overall unhelpful and seemed very unhappy.  If I owned the place, I would be pretty pissed if my employees marketed my products like this.  Or perhaps that's why it was on special, it was old/went bad?  Who knows. But it was the only things that I ate & drank that day and within about 10 minutes of consumption, I noticed my stomach already feeling weird. It got much worse fast from there. The place has visibly gone downhill since it was the Brass Tap, so would not surprise me if their tap line cleaning practices are not up to par, as it's apparent most other aspects of the place are neither. Needless to say, I will never return here.  There's tons of other choices in Ybor.",-0.9623

"Extremely disappointed with this location after giving it a second chance. As I was sitting waiting around for over 45 minutes for my burrito, I decided to read some other reviews and write my own. It's uncanny how the other low reviews had almost identical situations, and excuses used by the staff. 

I first visited this location about a week ago and dined-in with my girlfriend. I ordered tacos and she ordered a burrito bowl, and I was pretty surprised by the 30 minute wait for food. I've been a regular at several other Tijuana Flats in both the Orlando and Sarasota areas and have never waited that long for food. I figured it might be a fluke, and decided to give them a second chance. 

I stopped by this location yesterday 6/17/2020 evening and ordered a burrito and queso to go. I sat down, and watched as several other people placed orders after me. I thought nothing of it, but after about 15 minutes, I noticed everybody that had arrived after me for pickup had already left. 25 minutes go by and now I'm the only person waiting around for food, and there is only one other family in the store. After about 30 minutes, I pulled up yelp to kill some time and saw reviews stating that other customers had similar frustration with wait times and complained that staff were ""dancing in the back"" and staff provided the excuse that ""the printer was down"" so orders were missed. 

After 45 minutes, I approached the cash register and waited for someone to come out of the back. At this point, I just asked for a refund and was ready to leave and go find something else to eat. I was asked for my name so my order could be looked up. After the waitress went to the back and came back after a few minutes she told me ""the printer was down so they didn't get my order"". That's pretty incredible, considering 5-6 other people placed orders after me and they had no issues with getting their food.  I don't know if the shocked look on my face gave away the fact that I knew this was a lie after reading the other one star yelp review, but this prompter her grabbing a manager. The manager reiterated the ""broken printer"" excuse to me and offered a refund for my food. 

I'm disappointed for several reasons: unlike every other location, I have never seen the staff at this location ever come into the dining area and ask to refill drinks or to check on patrons, the wait times are pretty unreal for casual dining, and then to top it off I was lied to by the waitress and presumably the manager regarding the ""printer"". What should have been a 10 minute stop, turned into nearly an hour wait for my order to actually be fulfilled, and that's a lot of time wasted waiting around. By the time my food came out, I was so upset and annoyed with the way the situation was handled I lost my appetite. 

Mistakes happen, I can empathize with that, but to lie to my face about it makes me never want to give this location another chance.",-0.9884
"I ordered chicken chalupa supreme and Crunchwrap supreme with chicken was charged $9. Both of them only half filled with a couple of pieces of meat. I ask the cash to replace it.

Manager must be spending their whole day creating new aliases to leave positive reviews to counter the bad ones--cause I cannot truly believe anyone can have anything positive to say about this location--and management clearly isn't paying attention to what the employees are doing. I must be insane to have given them another chance. Live and learn.",-0.4386
"The servers in this this bar are the worst in Tampa. They think their Baywatch material. Not even close! The bartenders under pour to most guest and over pours to the regular misguided Carrollwood crowd that goes there! 

The bartenders do not know how to mix drinks and the turnover rate on the help reflects this. Training 101 is need for their lack of customer service. 

Food is way over priced and comes out cold for sitting in the kitchen too long. On top of no parking and a poor manager who needs to remember who pays for their lights to go on. 

Skip this place and do your self a favor by telling others its another one and done like every bar that's been in that location.",-0.555

I usually put it down to having a bad day but  I felt like I was being punked or on the set of Waiting this was that bad. Then looking at other reviews & the 2.5 stars I guess I wasn't. Unfortunately the food wasn't much better, I ended up pulling out big chunks of cilantro throughout my burrito. Lesson learned & never again.",-0.8722

"Terrible. Rude. Their manager is clearly not doing their job because the staff is some of the most terrible people. The reason the wait is so long is the staff is on their cell phones.

"This Taco Bell SUCKS. Tonight I ordered via Uber Eats, a very simple order of 3 regular soft tacos and a cheese roll up. 40 minutes later, my food was delivered (MY name was on the bag, so it was ""my order""), but nothing was right. The taco's were hard taco's with all of the extra toppings (including ones I am allergic to, hence why I ordered REGULAR), and we didn't even get the cheese roll up. Not to mention the food felt like it just came out of the fridge, it was so cold. I'm pregnant, and was starving, and so was my 2 year old. I called Taco Bell and told them they made everything wrong and didn't give me part of the order, and the ""manager"" told me it wasn't his fault and nothing he could do. He told me I'd have to contact Uber Eats even though TACO BELL made the food wrong. How is it Uber Eats fault? He basically told me too bad and hung up. How in the Hell my husband who's serving the country makes less than these idiots, I will never understand.",-0.9707

There was only one thing that we liked was the soup. Service was really bad. We waited really long for are food. We did not get some items we ordered. I got a no head flat beer. The other mixed drinks we ordered were not made correctly. My daughter and I spoke about it at the table. That maybe it's better at the bar I disagreed and I did tip 15% witch my wife was hot about. My other daughter is a server so we know the hole tip thing. I'm not going to go in to every problem there was. it would take to long. There were so many you would stop reading.

Been here several times in the past with no issue. Dropped by tonight and was confronted by multiple apparent homeless people from the minute we parked til we left.

"If looking for a small vegetarian salad on a soft shell (even though you've ordered steak) you've found the right place. But when I order steak tacos I expect steak and not a tablespoons worth. Tacos only half full, mostly with vegetables, just doesn't cut it. Bland taste to boot. No wonder they have all those hot sauces - to give the food taste. Rice was blah. Refried beans even worse. Like placed in the microwave on high for too many minutes. Not a good experience - especially considering the price they charge for simple tex-mex.  If you're going to use those large soft taco shells then fill them up!  Like the old saying goes, ""Where's the Beef?""  Not here...",-0.6404
"Taco Bus gave me the boogee.

Had been there a few times before and it was great. the sauces are excellent. Service is slow at best but the food made up for it. This time I thought my burrito tasted like the meat was old and I did not enjoy it at all.... Later that night I enjoyed it even less. It turned into one of those sleepless nights, up and down, in and out of bed, running to the bathroom,,,,, flowing heavy to say the least.

I never really felt comfortable about the food handling standards of the Taco Bus,,,, but usually have a cast iron stomach and no fear. Obviously either my stomach is deteriorating (very likely) or Taco Bus has the kind of staff that that is too stupid or too slack to rotate their product. Either way if I were you I would sniff that thing before you put it in your mouth!!!!",-0.7889
"This is establishment was terrible. They messed up everyone's order. There was a hair in my nachos. They want tips but don't take your order, they don't refill your drinks, and have an attitude when you tell them the order is wrong. I asked for a wet burrito with both queso and red sauce. I didn't get either. All of our food was cold. One of the worst restaurants I've ever been in.",-0.9246
"So as my last post about this got deleted,I will post AGAIN with details on how this is horrible food.
First off the food is dry and bland no flavor at all,I can make better burritos myself.
Second they use the lowest grade of cow meat the parts of the cow that if you know ACTUALLY what it was you would not eat it,The beef honestly has no flavor its not even shredded like REAL mexican food.

If you think this place is good you are SADLY mistaken it cannot compare to the Mexican food in San Diego(CA) or in Tijuana(Mexico)",-0.8335
"It's 2:24am and my boyfriend and I were wanting to grab a quick bite at the drive thru of Taco Bell. The employee that was working there had a napkin in between her ear and her drive thru headset ignoring all the people in line. There were four cars behind us. We drove up to the window to see if it was closed because they said they closed at 4am online. She made eye contact with us when we were trying to get her attention and then turned back around. My advice, find employees who want to work.",-0.34
"I have been waiting to write this review for days now, I went here with a large group of people last Saturday, at least 15 of us. It took an hour for me and others to receive our first drink, after they gave mine away to someone else. I ordered 3 of the same drinks that night all 3 tasted completely different. Not worth $12 a drink. Then it was time to order food. I ordered the octopus...It was the worst I've ever had, it was so chewy I could hardly swallow, I literally choked on $16 octopus... The service was horrible, the food was horrendous and the drinks were inconsistent. All 3 waitresses that we had were bad, so unprofessional. Myself, and the large group of people I went with were not impressed what so ever. I could have made all of our drinks faster than I got my first one. I will never go back there and I don't recommend it to anyone!!!!!!",-0.983

"You know, it took 30 minutes for a burrito...and the sour cream isn't even quality packets anymore. For the money... it's a total rip off. It tastes watered down, and you don't even get good sour cream anymore. What a shame. Seems like the burritos are getting smaller and higher priced per month. 
Used to be my go to place, but now that they have been complete sellouts I won't drive across town for that anymore. Better places for the same price, or less. 

5 years ago you used to get a huge burrito for $5 and that included a drink. Now, they seem greedy for profit. Lame sour cream and they raised the price to .30 a piece. Disgusting. Have more pride in the ""original"" taco bus. It's lame now. Overpriced and just a shame. Good food but high prices and on the rise !",-0.5196

Service was fine but the server never offered any type of drinks, food, specials, or anything for that matter. She just asked what we wanted each time she came to the table. Once the food came, half of it was cold and all of the dishes we ordered had ZERO flavor. 
We would never recommend or go back.. way to over priced and not worth it.",-0.4047

I grew up going to this Taco Bell and it's literally the worst, on average, I've ever been to. They repeatedly mess up orders, give small quantities, are out of certain fountain drinks, have poor quality food (even by Taco Bell standards), incredibly slow service, and often unfriendly and unprofessional staff. Not to mention potholes in the parking lot that go un-repaired for over a year.

Manager saw us sitting there and never once stopped by to apologize or offer to take a drink order.

You never know when they are closed or open and of course you can't call because they don't answer either way. 
After giving up on them I read all the positive review on yelp and thought to myself maybe because they were so new I had a bad experience let me give them another try. I decided to take my husband and my little one . 6. We were completely ignored when we were tying to order. They had about 4other people there and we didn't even get a  ""hi,we will be right with you"" which I think is business 101 etiquette. We decided to stand up and go near the food truck since it said order here, and were waiting 5 minutes still ignored by 2 people. We decided that was it and left.

There were several empty tables and by the time we finally got our food, the place was more than half empty. There was no good reason for the slow bad service and average food. There were 3 of us and we ordered 2 quesadillas and a 2 taco plate. Nothing too difficult. The food wasn't bad. It just wasn't great. Nothing to write home about. Very average Mexican food. It took more than 45 minutes to get our food and once it came, we didn't see our waitress again. She never checked on us and never brought us the check.

"Taco bus used to be a 4-5 star local restaurant but that's changed, unfortunately. I have tried it 5 times recently since moving to the Seminole heights area and have been disappointed every time at how poor the quality of food is. The one good thing about taco bus, however, was the horchata. It was the only thing that would bring me back, I'd get a gallon of it for the week. Now, when I go in to get my gallon they've raised the price from $10 to $15! When I asked the employee if that was right he told me the prices of everything have gone up. I'm confused why taco bus would increase their prices if they've decreased their quality. Can someone explain?",-0.8335
"I had a very depressing experience at Taps. We went for drinks and appetizers, but sadly our waitress made that simple task difficult. From the time we walked up to her she was busy on her phone. After being seated, We had to get another server to get our server after 15 minutes of waiting in a restaurant that only had 6 tables seated, totaling maybe 17 guests. We ordered two drinks and two appetizers. One was the Pho, which was removed from the menu and the main reason my wife wanted to eat here; she need a warm soup/broth. So we opted for the chilli. We ordered 2 drinks and 2 appetizers together. We got an appetizer first pretty quickly without utensils, at this time, i requested ketchup. I got the utensils, minus the ketchup. Then we got drinks, no ketchup. 20 minutes later, we got chilli, which was had just bean with chilli powder that you can taste the powder on your tongue. Still no ketchup. This waitress clearly was preoccupied on the phone for most of the night and chit chatting with coworkers.

Pro: calamari was properly fried, with fried peppers which I enjoyed.
Con: chilli, waitress.
Neutral: drinks, not my favorite, but that may just be my choices.

My burrito prenado was 90% beans with about three shreds of lettuce and one piece of squash. Used to be full of veggies. My wife's quesadilla was a stale tortilla with about a dozen shreds of half melted mozzarella cheese. I have no idea who they think they're fooling. I'll also add that it was absolutely dead when I went to get our dinner. Used to be that there was a line on any given evening at dinner time.

Cannot stress how nasty it is, wish I had the foresight to take a picture.    But I didn't and figured I'd give the place a chance after using the facilities right when I first got there.

Here are some of the things that went wrong in addition to the disgusting uncleanliness...

Two out of four menus had some type of wet grime on them...forcing another trip to the bathroom for daughter to wash her hands.

There was a long strand of hair in the salsa...manager was gracious enough to bring a different bottle of salsa and new bowl.

My daughter bit into something hard in her burrito and swallowed it and said she didn't know what it was.   She kept eating and found some type of hard stem in her food.  I told everyone in my party to stop eating and to leave and wait outside.   I informed the waiter of the issue, he consulted with somebody busing dirty dishes to the back, who then consulted with the manager.   Manager came over with a thyme leaf and said the hard part was a stem and they use the leaves in their seasoning.   Could be the culprit, but everything up to that point was so bad that I said we were done and they gave me a bill, of course didn't comp anything (or even offer to) and I paid it and left.   Best guess is we ate about 20% of the food brought to us, if that.  Won't ever go back to this dumpster.

"Arrived at International Plazza  early for my meeting, so I stopped in for a drink. What a mistake!
On a Thursday evening this place was a zoo.
People everywhere, even out in the rain. I am no hypocrite, their were people of all ages, but there were many I would have carded. There was so much noise & confusion.....too much drama!
My drink of choice is seldom beer, the wine selection was dismal, a slap in the face to wine drinkers & a serious problem with the establishment! Instead of being able to sit back, relax & enjoy my vino, I just wanted to get the hell out of this circus! Did I mention it was LOUD, SCREAMING LOUD & OBNOXIOUS, I should have kept walking.
I understand the name is TAPS, not VINO, but seriously, whoever purchases the wine needs a lesson in wine or maybe the hops have just gone to their head. The wine was disquesting & undrinkable. Unfortunately I made the mistake of ordering an appetizer when I ordered the wine. After waiting 15 minutes for undrinkable  wine, achieving a huge headache from the LOUD noise & confusion, people knocking into me every few seconds, after a long day, I didn't need this & certainally  did not need to abuse myself, when Tampa has so much to offer in GREAT wine & food.
I kept myself sane & removed myself for the chaotic scene of TAPS. Yes, thankfully we still have choices & rights. Okay, I paid for wine I couldn't drink & food I wasn't going to wait on, but I kept my sanity, moved on & had a delightful evening somewhere else!
What's a girl to do? sanity wins over chaos & drama every time. No not my type of establishment, I won't be back.",-0.7866

"Used to be my favorite place in Tampa, hands down.  Then one night, we took a visiting researcher from USF to the place and he found, kid you not, a BOLT in his burrito.  He went up and had a discussion with the guys in the bus and they just shrugged like it was no big deal. If that hadn't happened after a night of really terrible service at another location of theirs, I might still be a customer of theirs.",-0.024

Take out is ALWAYS wrong despite that it's actually a typed order. I can't understand the issue or why I continued to eat at this location for the last year. That was my mistake. Also, very stingy with portions. My one star is because of how much my family and I love Chipotle. So sad",-0.893

I feel bad because of course everyone is going through something in life but at the same time...there comes a point in time when you have evaluate why you're  throwing money at a customer because they actually had the nerve to COME BACK after you messed up their order and asked them to get in their car and drive BACK, using gas that's currently priced at $2.79. Just saying. 
It seems like customer service is a lost art and it's definitely apparent at this location. May the force be with them.",-0.4767

I got the twin tacos with chicken and carne asada. There was NO ONE waiting for food and still they forgot to add rice and beans to them. It was COLD and the meat was chewy. No flavors. Not mexican. Not yummy. At all.... Gave us the drinks closed so we had to get up and ask for a bottle opener. My husbands burrito was cold and watery. And  friends order missed a few ingredients too. So she had to wait longer. It Sucked.",-0.8698

On a Friday night with three patrons in front of me it took 20 minutes to get two chicken burritos.  THE SERVICE IS DISGUSTINGLY SLOW!

The burritos had very little chicken. Lots of cabbage tho.  Taco Bus started with good publicity and good products and now its just downright bad.",-0.5307
"Went for dinner here due to prior good reviews. Not good in my honest opinion. A small lunch like place with 6 small tables. To start, broken small tortilla chips served in a small silver bucket. Ordered steak enchiladas but got a plate of sauce that was poured over unopened tortilla shells with nothing inside. Under that in more sauce was very small steak bits too small to stab with a fork. When I talked to the owner, he said he was from Mexico city so the enchiladas were done his way. I sent the food back and ordered steak tacos as they don't use ground beef here,  lol. It was the most bland tasteless taco I've ever eaten with absolutely no flavor or seasoning with a soft tortilla shell that broke in your hand when I tried to pick it up to eat it. If this is authentic Mexico city food, please let me go anywhere else locally in the future. The family owned waiters wore shorts and golf shirts. Very unprofessional and tacky.",-0.5153

WTF? Are you serious? I explained to him that we had the menu and it states that a large queso is $9.00. Talk about an uncharge? The man made sure I was ordering from the correct location but didn't want to verify that the queso was 10.00 extra to carry out? We will never be ordering from this location ever again.",-0.6759
"No favor. Small portions for the amount of money. This is my first time ever rating a one star. Really surprised being on this strip of how bad the food is. Then we got a rude waitress.

$9 for two tacos, beans and rice is insulting.
Consistently disappointing.
Don't understand why a burrito takes so long to make.

"My goodness. What a complete and abject disaster. First off, we decided to try this restaurant since the last one wasn't good at all. There was a review in the local paper saying they were afraid nobody would give them a chance since they were a Mexican restaurant that basically took the place of the last Mexican restaurant that was short-lived. There are just not many good Mexican restaurants in North Tampa so we really wanted to give it a fair shake. Boy, was that a mistake.

The ambience was OK. It tries to have a vibe of a sports bar in the front and a regular restaurant in the back. The hostess was not sure how to seat us or the people behind us and had to wait for somebody else to come up to figure out what to do. She asked if we wanted to sit outside (we had 2 small kids and it was pitch dark). I thought that was an odd request. But so far, nothing crazy.

They have a salsa bar that is downright terrible. It kind of looks like the Moes salsa bar but the Moes salsa is 10 times better. And Moes salsa is not even that good.

My wife got the enchiladas and I got the pork Carnitas bowl. Her enchiladas were terrible. The pork Carnitas bowl was abysmal. No taste at all. This is by far the worst Mexican restaurant I have ever been to. The salsa and the dinners were so bland that we had to ask for sides of sour cream to mix into them to give them taste. 

The waitress was really nice but there were busboys and waiters everywhere. We had our drinks refilled only once. The two times we had to get up we had to work our way around all of the waiters and bus boys that were taking up the entire dining area. 

To top it all off, within 30 minutes of getting home, my wife got hit with food poisoning. I had only tried two salsas and had given up on it. She got about five different types. Since I tried her enchiladas we assume that it was one of the salsas. But who knows.

DO NOT GO HERE. Other than Tijuana Flats I don't know where else you can go for good Mexican in new Tampa. Vallartas is pretty good but they have had issues with cleanliness in the past and have been shut down over it. Maybe the taco bus on Fletcher. Otherwise, you're going to have to travel all the way to South Tampa to Miguel's.",-0.9394

They don't put hardly any food on your plate and when you ask for a little more of something they up charge for the standard amount you should have received. Awful chipotle here.",-0.9217

"Went in with 12 people for my daughters 29th birthday and the hostess said She was not going to let us in. Until she found out we were just drinking.  I went to bar Louis where they want all of my business. Not what was convenient for them. The customer is always right.
Chris the manager came to talk to me at bar Louie and apologized. He also sent a round of drinks to my daughter. At least he is trying. 
I got an e-mail the morning after from the owner apologizing. He spoke with the hostess her version was quite different from ours. According to her she informed us the kitchen was backed up and food service would be slow. The only problem was she came up to me yelling you can't come in here. Then she said to my daughter the only reason I am not kicking you out is because you guys are only drinking. The rudeness from the hostess was all about her power trip!",-0.4753
"Extremely rude staff. I'm surprised anyone eats here based on my experience, but perhaps we just had bad luck.",-0.3499
"Where do I start? When we arrived, they acted as if we were bothering them. I would understand if it were near closing time and we were there 15 minutes before they were closing, but it was the middle of the day. Then, while looking over the menu, we saw a roach crawl across the floor. That was it for us. We got up and walked out. They didn't even try to stop us and acted as if they were glad we were leaving. I have never had such horrible service and can't imagine anyone ever wanting to order food from there. Dine here at your own risk. I will be warning everyone I know to stay away from this wretched place.",-0.1469
"I have heard so many positive things about this restaurant. So I decided to go there with a friend during lunch.  I had a horrible experience with my chicken burrito and it was SO MUCH greasy all over the plates and the greasy was also dropping into my collars.  My friend had her burrito and she was NOT satisified as well. It tasted so fatty and gross! We felt that they cooked them so fast and did not care about the qualities of their food. They appeared to be rush to make them away!  I wouldn't recommend anyone try this place!",-0.4612
"We went in about 2 months ago, they were out of tamales, the enchiladas were not really good, my mom did not like the food at all. The carne asada was okay, but not the best. Won't go there again.",-0.7557
"We decided to give this place a try. Fish tacos - generous portion but way too much batter and very greasy. The shrimp/bacon tacos were very SKIMPY on ingredients and nothing to get excited about especially since there was no bacon to be found. $22.00 for an unimpressive meal. California Taco and Ray's Fish Camp are much better  options for the price. We did notice must people were getting the bowls so maybe that's the way to go here.",-0.3515
"If the service had matched the beer list it would have been a sub par experience at best.....I guess you get what you pay, the food sucked as well as the aforementioned service...I would have stayed longer had the waiter at least checked on my beer status....",-0.3182
"Food is far from authentic in the worst possible way!!! I ordered tamales and sopapillas... my favorite Mexican dishes. Tamales very dry, no flavor and covered with ground beef. Soapapillas were like a deep fried chip. So disappointed!",-0.7677
"This place was much more reasonable when it was a stand.  Since the new location (2007, maybe?), the prices have been ludicrous.  The last time I went, I got a vegetarian burrito with no extras and a bottle of High Life for about $10.  The burrito was pathetic and contained little more than lettuce and tomato.  It was not even slightly filling or memorable, especially not at that price.

The tacos are OK, but they are also very small, cost about $3 a piece at minimum, and have very little filling.  Vegetarian tacos are a rip-off, you are forced to make them double-deckers and all they do is take the meat out, no extra filling or anything.  They have a club card that gives you a free taco after 10, but the free veggie taco still costs the extra $1.25 double-decker charge.  It should also be noted that there is no free water available, the employees always seem agitated with taking orders, there is a minimum charge for debit cards, and the bathrooms look like they get cleaned maybe once a month.

I understand where the owner's coming from, and he's told me about how difficult the move has been on him financially while also being more convenient for him, but I think he went in over his head and has really screwed over his customers as a result.",-0.7733
"After walking out from that horrible Irish Pub next door my partner and I came to this place. It was much quieter and had more of a family appeal. Was relatively clean and service was fast.  However I had to ask for water twice. The food was ok but not great. Combination dinner suppose to come with beans and rice however that didn't happen. Also the spicy tacos were just too spicy to the point you can't enjoy the meal.  Have eaten at a lot of Mexican restaurants and this is definitely in the fair to midland area. Would not recommend.",-0.5924
"The food is okay but very over priced 2 quesadillas $25 and they wouldn't give me any sour cream unless I paid more for it a dollar each extra ... I have no problem paying for food I order but after paying $25 dollars for only 2 quesadillas I would expect they include sour cream for free ... that manager refused to accommodate me and it's a shame they lost my business over sour cream ... if you run a business you should learn your customers is who helps run your success and if they are unhappy then your not going to be very successful ... very disappointed",-0.5499
"I'll never eat at the Taco Bus again!  I ordered a burrito at a concert at the amphitheatre last summer and when I bit into the second half, I found a BAND-AID!!!  Beyond disgusting!  When I returned it, they didn't believe me and tried to tell me they all wear gloves and there was no way it could have come from them.  Ultimately, they gave me my money back, but it was a very bad experience.

P.S. The first, Band-Aid free half was not that good either!",-0.8324
"I wish I hadn't eaten here.  I was visiting friends in the area and wanted to take them to dinner  somewhere nice and not the usual (Chillis, Outback etc...).  The service was slow, it took over 30 minutes for a party of five to get drinks.  The margaritas were TERRIBLE!  The food quality was the equivalent of Taco Bell.  I was embarrassed because I chose this place.  I don't know if I visited on an ""off"" night, but the restaurant was not crowded.   I won't try it again and would not recommend.",-0.1214
"Fish was fishy, paid 14 bucks for a few chips little guac and food with no flavor. Their fish tacos are suppose to be the best on the menu , it wasn't good at all. Can only imagine what the other stuff tastes like. I didn't know you could mess up mexican food this bad.",-0.547
"I went through their drive thru late at night and there were 2 people supposedly ""working""- they overcharged me twice, they tried to charge me 2.40 for asking for chicken instead of beef, then the guy ""Carl"" got out a calculator! He said plain chicken soft tacos were $ 2.13 a piece-WRONG! Maybe they do this to everyone a pocket money for each person. The WORST SERVICE EVER!!! Then I asked for a receipt and He told me ""No receipts"". Then I asked the high school girl cashier for mild sauce. She forgot that too, twice! I was waiting In an uber to boot. I need my money back, I need a manager to contact me. Not a lot of money, but the principle!! Don't people want to work anymore!!? AWFUL!!!!",-0.7199
"The $1 tacos are horribly disgusting. I couldn't even pick one up without having it fall apart because of how immensely soggy the taco was. After I forced myself to clear about half of the plate, all I saw on my plate was greasy WATER. Not even juice from the meat, but it looked as if the chicken I had inside my tacos were soaked in a greasy water broth, and the chef just slapped it onto cheap taco shells and served it that way. Our waitress never visited or checked on our table when we were running low on beverages. She didn't come by even once for the 30 minutes we sat there after dropping off our food. She also rushed us to pay (Gee, wonder why.) before we got to even eat. 
Overall, extremely bad quality food and bad service. Do not eat here.",-0.9597
"Horrible staff working the day I went. I have never had a problem at chipotle until now. I came in a few weeks ago and had a couple orders(work). As they started to make one of the burritos they were putting barely anything on it, almost half from normal. The amount of rice she put on it wasn't even enough to feed a rat I politely asked for some more rice. She finished the burrito and as I said it had half the stuff they normally put in. She attempts to wrap it and it goes everywhere to where I say I need it re made. She rolls her eyes as if I asked a huge favor (it's my money and I want it made right, not too much to ask for) the other girl came over and was going to double wrap it I said no I need it re made I do not want it double wrapped as it was for a co worker not me. They were so rude Rolling their eyes as they re made it. The worst part was there weren't people waiting so it wasn't a big deal. If the manager was there I would've had a conversation with him or her. I work in customer service and I want to be treated right. I have had a chipotle employee mess up the wrap and offer on his own to re make the wrap.

I would not have been upset if the girls were just polite and re made my order without the eye rolling.",-0.7798
"Ok so where do I start.  My husband and I thought it best to try out this place because I heard it was like a spot back home in Chicago.  When we get there my husband had to use the restroom which is outside so when he heads that way a female flings a cigarette right in front of him as if he was not there.  Extremely rude.

So we waited about 20 minutes for our $10 tacos and we ordered a pepsi while waiting.  I drink pepsi DAILY therefore I know when it is not right.  My husbands drink was also bad so we took it up to the cashier and explained that it was a BAD batch of PEPSI.  The cashier proceeded to tell my husband that if we wanted ANOTHER drink we would have to purchase because it was not there problem.  
So then we finally get our tacos the meat inside was stil pink from not being done and the shells were soaking wet so they were not as crisp.  We were afraid to say anything due to we would probably have to pay for that.  
Overall the SERVICE was horrible and I am not confident we will ever go back.  Its for some but not for others.  I also think that MAYBE they just had a BAD night or they need a  class in proper ettiquette because I am not sure I would lose a customer over a FLAT pepsi.",-0.7969

"This is the second time I've this location and it still sucks. The people that work there has one speed and it's SLOW. First time I tried the burrito and it had so much rice that I couldn't even taste any meat. Today I tried the tacos. Let's say the meat was luke warm, the hot sauce was ""mild "",guacamole was bland, and the lettuce looked awful. The genius behind the counter wrapped all the tacos together in aluminum foil so when I unwrapped the foil all the tacos were stuck together and also made the tortillas soggy. But I must say the chips were good!!! Gave this place 2 chances and both times it was awful, won't be a third!!!",-0.4438

"Living in Tampa for years now, Taco Bus was always a favorite. The inconsistency started happening about two years ago. No location offered the same vegan options, the orders were constantly messed up at the hillsborough and st Pete locations, and the wait times were ridiculous (under staffed). Last night we were told by the late night staff that they will no longer carry dairy-free cheese... No biggie, they still have a handful of vegan options. In addition to that, we placed an order and for 40 minutes we watched others who came after us get their food. When we brought this to the staffs attention they said, whoops we must've skipped your ticket. No apology, no accountability. We waited another 15 minutes after forgiving the mistake and still had not received our food... Taco bus is quick service! We then asked for a refund. Still NO apology from the staff. Between friends and family, the guests at the hotels I manage and personal business... Taco Bus will no longer be recommended. There are too many other local spots in the Tampa Bay Area that deserve your business.",-0.8599

"We regularly order from here for lunch as it is close to our hospital. On multiple occasions over the last few months there have been items missing or incorrect orders all together. The latest issue was an order that was delivered via DoorDash, again with missing food. I called and spoke with an associate whom told me they couldn't do anything for me and to call DoorDash. I spoke to a male manager who again told me the same. Although they are the ones that prepared and packaged the food, they placed the blame on the courier service. When I asked for a refund, again the answer was to speak with DoorDash. Picking up the missing items was impossible considering we work in a hospital had to use a courier service. The manager then proceeded to tell me that he would personally make sure I received the missing food. And would you know what?! It never showed. So not only is this establishment inept in properly preparing and packing food, they are also untrustworthy in their word in customer satisfaction. I will never order from here again.",-0.5255

Little did we know that someone who was preparing it had dropped a piece of plastic or synthetic material in the mixture and when we ate the quesadilla it tasted like poison and the taste was so dominant that not even flushing it out with immense amounts of water helped. I am not certain what kind of chemical mixture we ate but after this horrifying experience I honestly don't ever want to eat Taco Bell again.",-0.6803

"My wife and I moved here from Austin 12 years ago and were in need for some Mexican food. We have tried all of their locations across Tampa and Pasco county. We have been to this outlet about a hundred times because the location was spot on for us and the margaritas were good. We discovered the  Molcajete and were quite impressed. The rest of the food is slightly subpar to very bad. Tacos El Pastor is also worth a try. The gringo server, John, recommended them to me. 

We have known John for several years and had a great relationship with all of the staff. One day we were literally the only customers in the whole place around 4 pm. We sat at the bar in front of many televisions with the same freaking soccer game playing on all of them. We asked John to put something else on the one in front of us. I still don't know what happened next, but he got extremely rude about some tv rules for us and then said ""you did not come here to watch tv, you came here to eat! What do you want?"" I said ""l MIGHT still order after you give me the tv rules."" He flipped out on us and I could not calm him down asking if he was just having a bad day. He told me ""we were his bad day!"" AND A LOT MORE came spewing from him!

After over tipping John at least 25% for years we were floored. We don't know what happened with him that day but the food and service were not worth another single visit. We have since spent hundreds of dollars at Tijuana Flats in the same complex. They love our visits over there and now get overtipped instead of John. 

Also try the other Vallaritas at 54 and Suncoast Parkway. Much better atmosphere and outside area! And not far away from this dank dive.",-0.5831
"Worse service ever.  Not one employee greeted me nor made me feel welcome.  Whomever the young lady was that was rolling the burritos needs to be trained again.  I came to this location because it was the only one open when I got off work.  I will never come back to this location.",-0.2297

"I had just flown in to Tampa International Airport and decided to get a quick take-out from this store. Upon returning home, I noticed the meximelt was missing from the order, even though it was clearly marked on the receipt. I called the store to tell them. The shift manager - ""Shantae"" - was unprofessional, starting with her poor phone etiquette. I told her about the missing meximelt, and she insisted that she put it in the bag herself. So, let's add being argumentative with a customer, along with lying about doing something that she never did. She said she would make my order, but I told her I'm not driving 15 minutes from the other side of town. I told her I want a refund. She refused to do that, telling me I would have to call the store manager in the morning. Why do I have to call Taco Bell to chase down a mistake they made? I told her she should call me, since it was their mistake and my money. She flatly told me that would not happen. I then told ""Shantae"" that I would be calling corporate office about this, and she hung up on me. Let's recap:

1) Taco Bell left an item out of my order, in spite of it being on the receipt.
2) The shift manager was unprofessional and argumentative.
3) The shift manager lied about putting the meximelt in the bag herself, even though it was not in the bag.
4) She refused to refund my money.
5) She told me to call the store manager about a refund, effectively making me pursue a remedy for their screw-up.
6) She hung up on me.

This is how you do business, Taco Bell? Unprofessional conduct, incompetence, a deliberate lack of accountability, and a rude shift manager who hangs up on an unhappy customer. Way to fail.",-0.9952

And lets discuss the people who work at this location.  i wouldnt hire them. Poor manners, inattentive, moping around looking busy.  Just the worst.  This poor excuse for a food vendor owes me 25 MINUTES of my life. Thats how long it took to get a taco and burrito at 10pm june 8, 2019.  Why wait you ask?  Simple, i was stuck.

"One star based on one bad visit, but it was BAD. This review is for this store, not company.. Here's why.

Undercooked chicken. After the guy in front of me noticed the batch of chicken was undercooked, he asked for a refund & didn't take the food. The girl behind the counter continued to make mine like I also didn't have undercooked chicken on my bowl. It blew my mind. I had them remake my bowl with chicken & reached out to corporate. I'm usually not a complainer on here but that's a serious deal. The entire staff behind the line was completely clueless on what undercooked / raw chicken looks like.",-0.4838
"I was very disappointed with this place. I ordered the tacos al pastor and the carnitas. The tacos al pastor tasted extremely bland like they where tacos a la boiled. No flavor whatsoever! The carnitas tasted like they boiled the meat and put it on the very thin a dry tortilla they give you, just horrible!!!! The meat stew was like drinking dirty dish water with leftover meat inside. The girl that took our order was rude. We had to eat our tacos with a fork because the tortilla split in half from the tasteless meat. The tastiest part about our meal was the onion and cilantro on top of our taco. Just horrible! Do yourself and your wallet a favor and go to taco bell across the street! I would not recommend this place. Maybe it was good at some point but not anymore.",-0.4314
"For $4 you can buy a single, palm-sized taco with a couple tablespoons of filling. No chips and salsa with that. I felt ripped off paying $12 for street food that was eaten in 3 bites. Tacos are the cheapest food to make and they're not using Wagyu.",-0.296

"Extremely disappointed in Taps Burger Bar and Gastropub. It took a significant amount of time to get seated which should have been a warning to how slow the service would be. My family and I walked by earlier and were wondering why it was the only restaurant that didn't have a wait, now we know why. It took over 10 minutes to get seated, another 15 to have someone take our order, and then over 30 to actually get our food. 

When our food arrived, much to our dismay we were very disappointed. I ordered the American Royal burger which was dry and did not have the House sauce that it was supposed to come with. We also ordered the brick chicken which was a smaller than expected portion size, risotto that wasn't fully cooked and soaked in oil. The final thing we ordered was the steak tacos and we couldn't even finish them.

"I wish I could give this place a negative number of stars. I'm only giving one star because I HAVE to in order to post. It was awful!! The manager is a joke! We ordered 5 meals the steak tacos were ice cold, the blackened fish tacos were raw, my son ordered a BLT with no cheese, it came with cheese and it took 30 minutes for them to remake it. What could possibly take 30 minutes to make a BLT, I mean really! We were all finished with our food before his BLT came back to the table. When we brought it to the attention of the manager be looked dumbfounded and didnt know what to say. His customer service is terribly lacking. He did apologize and said he would fix the bill. We had to wait another 20 minutes for the bill. He did take my raw fish taco off the bill and gave a very small discount but left the other cold tacos on the bill. Meanwhile the waitress suggests next time we go to Rocco Tacos! Will do ladyl! This place was terrible from wait time to customer service to food absolutely nothing good to say about this place!! I recommend staying far away from this place!!!",-0.8791

The punk ass they have working behind the counter named George refused to provide an ICE WATER to-go with my order, which is an overpriced $20 order of fajitas ""on special"", mind you. To add insult, he refused to speak Spanish to me when I walked in, and lied about only speaking English, moments before speaking fluent Spanish to another customer on the phone. If that wasn't enough, when I tried to ask ""his mother"" for a plastic silverware set, she shut the door and sent her jerkoff son back out to deal with it. Then after I decided to have a few bites before leaving, I was chastised for eating there. Like you'd get a tip anyway, you douche bags. I'll never be back here.",-0.9704

"The quality of this Taco Bell depends largely on who is working there and at what time you go. Sometimes, the stuff is spot on, but last night and other nights when I have gone at 1am, it's been really god awful. To the point where my husband and I were actually sick today because of them not cooking the food. There were no toppings on the chalupas, no hot sauce in the bag, the shells were not crunchy; they tasted like someone made them at 9pm and then kept them out all night. We paid for spicy ranch and didn't get it, honestly, I don't ask for much at 1am, but it was just so horrible last night I can't be quite about it. I really hope they get a new manager for that shift or just a new employee that will cook the food properly, I mean it's Taco Bell, but come on.

I feel sick now and will not visit this establishment ever again. This is not the first time that they served me this weird meat, I gave them another shot thinking it was a one time thing. I was very mistakened. 

The oil in which the jalapeños and onions were fried in tasted like it was weeks old. Salsa was weird too, very watered down I don't know what happened with this food a couple of weeks ago it was fine.  They requested that I take the tacos that I threw out in the garbage instead of just crediting me for the 4 that were crappy.",-0.8823

We were told the kitchen was backed up but was turning things around, so we went ahead (against our better judgement) and ordered some burgers. We've been waiting now for close to an hour....no food....no update.... NOTHING. To add insult to injury, the server spilt my drink all over the table and floor (didn't offer a replacement) and spilled one of the apps across the table.  I've asked for the manager at least four times and the bloke can't even condescend to come over and apologize for the horrendous service. They didn't comp any of the ticket and, honestly, it doesn't appear they care one iota about how awful they've been. Many tables came after, we're seated, served, and left with us still sitting here.

I'm trying to complete my order I understand I have an accent but as I am trying make sure the young lady gets the order the right way another guy jumps in and won't let me fully explain or talk at all (as if they thought I was drunk and tried to make me upset on purpose somehow taking pleasure on that, not knowing I just worked for over 15 hours) . As a result, gave me the wrong order (once again on a similar situation). In the end who I assume was the manager approached the window to say bye sarcastically once again knowing I was upset one more time trying to escalate the situation rather that de-escalating it as all managers should be trained to do. She chose to not represent the brand and fail to provide customer service which is part of the business she is in.

You never know when they are closed or open and of course you can't call because they don't answer either way. 
After giving up on them I read all the positive review on yelp and thought to myself maybe because they were so new I had a bad experience let me give them another try. I decided to take my husband and my little one . 6. We were completely ignored when we were tying to order. They had about 4other people there and we didn't even get a  ""hi,we will be right with you"" which I think is business 101 etiquette. We decided to stand up and go near the food truck since it said order here, and were waiting 5 minutes still ignored by 2 people. We decided that was it and left.

Chips and salsa is $2.25 a basket, be aware! There was no difference between the enchilada and burrito, and most food was burnt beyond recognition with zero seasoning. 

I ordered a chile relleno, and it looked like vomit on my plate. The pepper was not even there, and the server argued with me about it being a poblano and that i should google what a poblano is. Chile relleno literally means ""stuffed pepper"" but there was no pepper.

I also spent 20 years in the restaurant industry, so I know when corners are being cut. I say that to let you know that we KNOW true, authentic Mexican food.  This place is a JOKE!!  I ordered a Chile Relleno, and go a melted mass of white cheese and some diced canned chiles. The ground beef that they used was CLEARLY prepared at least the day before.  There is no spice, flavor, heat, depth of flavor, or ""kick"" that makes you realize that you are eating Mexican cuisine.  NOTHING here is authentic.  The beans are canned, the rice is packaged, and the seasoning is absolutely non existant.  How this place has multiple locations is beyond me, because this level of abuse to the Mexican culture and cusine would NEVER FLY with people who have even a baase level of experience with authentic Mexican cooking",-0.4055

I got a big order and all the orders where messes up no sour cream on none of the tacos, meat was cold.

"The young man taking my order was rude and unpleasant from the get go and throughout the whole transaction.  He didn't hear me order a cheese quesadilla for my daughter and when I realized it and pointed that out after the rest of my order was up, he was annoyed and accused me of not ordering it.  I paid $11.26 on a card for the previous items at the onset and tipped $5 cash.  The initial order included 3 chicken tacos, 2 bean tacos and an order of chips and guacamole.  When I pulled cash out to pay for the plain cheese quesadilla he quoted me $5, it felt like he was being unethical.  The food was bland at best, but the dozens of flies circling the outdoor seating didn't seem to mind.

I will never be back nor could I possibly recommend this place to anyone I know who likes Mexican food.",-0.3432

Wrong order, only realized when I got home. I ordered the Portobello quesadilla: it was ground beef.
Cheese wasn't even melted, all the ""toppings"" were inside the ""quesadilla"", making it cold slop. 
It was inedible, truly. I only took one bite and had to throw it away. So disappointing, so hungry now.",-0.5709

"I went here to San Jose's (formerly Vallarta's) for lunch about a month ago with my husband. We ordered guacamole to start as well as a large margarita. The margarita was bright green colored like it came from a gallon jug from supermarket. The guacamole had ice chips in it and was very watery and not the typical brighter green color. It had no flavor. So we asked for the check before ordering our mains and left. I didn't even have a sip of my drink. We did leave a tip although the service was not up to par. 
The place was empty for a Saturday afternoon which I thought was odd but after receiving poor quality drinks and guacamole, now I know why. 
Today I saw on the  news that restaurants are making mock guacamole because of the higher cost of avocados. This now explains why we didn't like San Jose's/Vallarta's. It had the same characteristics that was described on the ABC News so I had to write this review.",-0.69
"Wow.  I just had the most disappointing meal that I've ever ordered from a restaurant. Everything was wrong. Correction: they remembered no onions. Other than that, everything was wrong. So sad to see the quality of their food deteriorate. The insides of the tacos and quesadillas were a soggy mess that made the wrong-shell tacos a soggy mess. This place used to be sooooo fresh!!!  Now that they've franchised, they're like the CiCi's Pizza of Mexican food.  :(",-0.9378

Nope.
The service was great. Customer service was awesome. But man, the food is SO inedible. I don't even think it's the chefs or cooks fault, I genuinely believe the recipe and food they use are just awful because it doesn't natter which Tijuana flats you visit, they're all terrible. This isn't even some ""it's just Americanized Mexican that's why"" no, this is inedible and disgusting quality food. Every single item in the menu has the same issue. We ordered and left everything after 2 bites even after being extremely hungry. Tampa and the food reviews are notorious for being so awfully wrong.",-0.981

A lady in the back restocking there sandwich table looks out sees me and another guy waiting still nothing. This happens twice. I finally asked the lady for a manager she doesn't even understand a little. So the lady in the back comes out with a real shitty attitude. I ask is this how you do things no one even acknowledges a person she said yeah tell me what you want to eat. I said forget you. She then screams fuck you. So I said the same thing and called her a bitch. She proceeds to keep screaming and cussing in Spanish like I don't understand. Then follows me outside and keeps telling. I will never go to any taco bus ever again. And can only keep my fingers crossed for your failure in business.",-0.9714

I placed an online order only to be met with the workers at the establishment telling me that some other customer took my order because one of their coworkers, Elijah, allowed it. They were out of the protein I selected for my order and instead of making me what I ordered they suggested I switch to a different protein option. I was very unpleased with my experience and hope that this never happens again as this is the Chipotle I typically go to. Really was let down by their customer service when instead of making the order I payed for already they suggested I changed it rather then accommodating the order.",-0.0258

As I was standing on the left side of the cashier ,I noticed the women with grayish purple hair who was quite thin scratch her butt then immediately touch the tortillas. Not to mention that she was not wearing a mask. I was absolutely disgusted and had lost all my appetite after witnessing this. I will never return to lolis after this unprofessional disgusting behavior.",-0.9227
"After several years of driving past and never stopping in, the stars aligned, and my schedule put me right next to this location with time to kill around lunch.

I was with 2 coworkers. I ordered a bottle water and a sweet tea to drink and an empanada as an appetizer. I then had a burrito for my main dish. After 15 minutes they informed me that they didn't have any tea ready and brought me a coke (which I didn't ask for). The water was never rang in and thus never brought. The empanada was never brought and after seeing it on the bill after the meal I informed them that I never received this either. This was actually made but the server took it to the wrong table (hope they enjoyed it-and you're welcome).  As for the burrito- halfway through it was frozen!!!!  Needless to say I will not be returning and this place was a MASSIVE disappointment.",-0.7348

Not a good enough explanation for me. I said I didn't want it. No refund, replacement, or apology received. Terrible customer service.

Visited during middle of NHL & NBA playoffs. Had to ask to put on NHL playoff game. Shouldn't have to at a bar like this, but nonetheless, when I asked the response was, ""Sorry, it's stuck on this channel and I can't change it.""

"The only employee at this establishment that I would give a five star rating to is Leo. He's always pleasant to everyone when they are ordering despite how particular some orders are.

This location is close to my work so I go here for lunch. 

The problem, the employees (aside from Leo) all have really horrible attitudes. If you request specifications on your orders they scoff. 

One young woman was so nasty that when I asked her to use a light amount of Pico on my order she kept scooping it on. When I repeated I asked for light she rudely rolled her eyes and barked out,""Well I didn't hear you so I just kept scooping it..""

I am not typically one to give a hard time to people who are handling my food but I reacted to her behavior. I told her that her attitude was atrocious and I didn't want her touching my food and I asked someone to remake it. 

They are so incredibly inconsistent here with portions as well. I had asked for light beans and one girl literally put 3 beans on the taco I ordered that day. Seriously?

If Leo isn't working I'm usually disappointed. Promote him. Clean up house.",-0.4832

"I have eaten at the original Taco Bus on Hillsborough and it was great.  Over the years they have expanded to many other locations.  I work off of I-4 and County Line Road and there is a Taco Bus that is opening at a gas station I go to.  They finally had their menu up and it was so disappointing that I won't even try it.   Pick your base, add your protein, add your toppings; each priced separately.  So commercialized and so much like Taco Bell.  Very disappointing.  Not even a mention of cilantro and onions but they had cabbage as a topping.  Whew! There is a little convenience store down on Buchman that has a little kitchen in back where you can get authentic tacos with all the toppings and all for one price.  Thats where I will continue to go.  It is too bad that expansion of what was a great restaurant has almost ruined it, in my opinion.",-0.4818
"Take out buyers beware . . . Food was fine, not a great value and inauthentically spicy, but fine. What bothered me, however, was that there was an item missing from my take out order. I called the restaurant immediately, but the person with whom I spoke (Mark?) simply waved it off (blamed the new person who was, apparently, not trained to put all the items ordered in the bag) and refused to rectify the situation for me unless I went back there to the restaurant (20 minutes away). I could have easily been refunded as I'd used a credit card, but that was not offered. Look, at a time when restaurants are struggling and relying on take out to stay afloat, there are plenty of great options that would not only offer good food but also would back it up with accuracy and good customer service.

"Went here last week on 12/22/2018 with a girlfriend.
We were looking to get some food after shopping for a little while and came across this place.
I have never been here before so I was excited to try new stuff.
I got in, and it seemed not too busy but I had to wait about 10 minutes before I was sat. It was weird because some people saw that we were waiting and didn't say a word... I mean we look a little young, so maybe that made them think we're not as important as people that were there seemed a little older that we were.
We sat down and wanted to grab some drinks, so when the waitress (blonde hair female) asked us what we wanted to drink, we said we will take a look at the menu. She left us and didn't come back for more than 10 minutes. We were sitting by the bathrooms in the corner because it was cold in the center area (maybe it was bc of this..?). Anyways, we ordered food. We asked for tacos that had tuna and they were out of tuna or some sauce that goes in the tacos. We ended up ordering shrimp tacos and an app. It was about 30 minutes of waiting time. We got shrimp tacos, and 5 minutes later got our appetizer... Surprise surprise. Shrimp tacos were okay least to say. 2 tiny tacos for $9. another $10 appetizer that had three breads with some tomato and cucumber on top.  Our waitress never came to ask if food was ok...
Bad experience overall. 
I would not recommend this place.",-0.1689

"When this restaurant is the only one  with no wait, that should be the first red flag. But, with a toddler, desperate times call for desperate measures. At just before 6pm on a Saturday, we walk into a half seated restaurant.  It takes some time to get service. Good news, we're able to decide on EVERYTHING we want. Everything gets ordered and the wait begins. Our appetizer comes first, before the drinks. Our pretzel that looked like it came straight from the box to our table was 2nd red flag. Again, we're hungry. We deal. Still no drinks. I go to the bar to find out what happened to them, as our waitress was no where to be found. After several minutes of standing at a very (dirty) backed up bar, I am acknowledged and able to place my order. Again. A few more minutes pass and finally our drinks! 
Now, we wait some more. After over 45 minutes of waiting our dinner arrives. 2 cheeseburgers and a kids grilled cheese. I did not even have a chance to look at our meals, as I was too busy examining the grilled cheese. The brioche bun was inside out and the cheese was not melted, at all! Coated in grease. We were done. I sent back the grilled cheese (still no waitress) and asked for that to be taken of the bill. At that time another (Godsend) waitress overheard, apologized and told us not to worry about anything. We had to go to the food court to feed our daughter! A complete waste of time.

"I've been at this location on Fowler avenue several times and the food is far inferior to your typical Tijuana Flats with smaller portions and the inside of the restaurant is always dirty. So yes the food in this location normally is horrible but the reason for this review is because the lady working the register Sunday afternoon was so rude to a family that walked in without masks. The lady working the register shouted across the entire restaurant so that everyone stopped what they  were eating and doing and she yelled ""don't come in here without a mask on"" The family of 4 walked back out to their vehicle got masks came back in and as they were placing their order she said to the mom/wife ""you need to cover your nose or we will NOT serve you! "" The entire restaurant was embarrassed for the family!!!! Horrible lady, horrible representation of Tijuana Flats and the worst part about the whole thing is that the other lady working with her laughed when she said it and the family was so embarrassed that they left. This kind of behavior should not be tolerated or allowed. I'll never eat it this location and hopefully anyone that reads this review will not support this location just out of principle. My wife and I got up and left along with another couple that was sitting across the room. I let the employee know when we left that what she did was nasty and uncalled for and no family deserves to be talked to like that & it's costing the people paying her paycheck business. She replied ""whatever bye"" If the manager of this location is concerned about their business income or the reviews that come in hopefully they read this and fire the two extremely rude & unprofessional employees that were working Sunday afternoon at 3:45 PM on November 15, 2020",-0.9934

"I love my Chipotle burritos but I have had to stop going to this restaurant - Why? Because even though there are signs at the entrance saying the county requires face masks because of the Covid-19 pandemic, customers are allowed in without them. Not just to pick up an order from the cashier, which would be quick and maybe not that much of a risk to everyone else, but to stand in line and then at the counter a foot away from the almost completely unprotected food prep area. Florida has emerged as the top hot spot for this pandemic in the last few weeks, setting new records almost every day. If people want to ignore that and kill themselves, great, go for it.

We've overlooked frequent bouts of food poisoning, explained away bad service, and tolerated inconsistent pricing when checking out. However, last night was the last straw for us. 

I stopped by for takeout and upon reviewing my bill, I noticed a ""take out fee"".  Now, to be fair it was only a dollar, it it's the principle.

I ordered chilles rellano and I was given a big slop of cheese with a slice of a pepper buried underneath.  The refried beans were so microwaved that they melted in with the cheese.  Not to mention that we waited quite a while to even get water from our waitress while the table in front of us was tended to multiple times thoughout the evening.  When I told the waitress I was not happy with the food and questioned why I only got a slice of a pepper she said thats what you ordered; no I did not order a slice of a pepper the size of my pinky smothered in cheese.  Also, the salsa tasted like pure tomato sauce with some hot pepper.  Never did a manager come to our table to speak with us and the fellow at the register didn't have much to say either when I paid for our drinks.

It took a bit for our food, but not an unreasonable amount of time, but our meals came out one at a time. No one at the table was impressed. 

I got the fish tacos and they didn't have much flavor and were very dry. No sauce or sour cream or anything like that to cut the dryness of the lettuce, cilantro, and onion. The tortillas basically fell apart just by being picked up. 

The chicken flautas were also a disappointment. The chicken was dry and lacking flavor. Topped with lettuce, tomato, and very little sour cream. The rice and beans that accompanied them was not hot and lacking flavor. 

The mole enchiladas were okay. They were served open faced, not rolled like I've had elsewhere. Once again, rice and beans not hot and lacking flavor.

She was so rude and disrespectful and her little friend/sidekick too. Well, the owner Tom you need to do better who you allow working at your business cause some people will run it to the ground.

"HORRIBLE! Very rude towards us and one other elderly woman that was in the store. Majority of items were out of 
stock at 1 pm. They sold us 2 soda fountain drinks knowing the machine was out of ice. 
I asked for steak vs ground beef. My ""steak"" was little balls of chewy meat that I ended up spitting out & not eating. The guacamole that you pay extra for is store bought, disgusting, tasteless ""baby food"" purée. 
The elderly lady that was in the store with us apparently wanted a crunchy fish taco. She got a flour tortilla, not knowing what is was. She asked where the taco was & where the fish was. I saw it. There was like 2 1/2 crumbles of fish. When she asked her questions & showed it to them before she had even taken a bite, they made her feel stupid by saying you pick up the flour circle and then you'll have a taco! Never in my life have I seen an elderly person treated so disrespectful. 
Oh and as I said, it was just my bf & I, and this elderly woman. We ordered tacos & nachos. Took FOREVER! 
And the place was filthy. Every table was dirty & wobbly, the drink station was dirty & the bathrooms were dirty. I informed them that the women's room was out of paper towels. We were there for an hour (mostly waiting on our food) and nobody went into the bathroom to replenish paper towels while we were there & none of the tables were washed down. Once we picked up our food order & sat down, the staff disappeared behind the wall. One man peeked out momentarily obviously chatting on his phone.

"Visited during the COVID-19 pandemic. They have their dining area closed but are taking online and takeout orders. I tried to get their website to function so I could place our order there for pickup however I cannot get any area for special instructions for each order. So I opted to call however they will not take orders over the phone.  Get the fact that it ties up their staff however especially in a time such as this it would be helpful. I got frustrated and we just went there and ordered in the restaurant. They are busy busting through online and pickup orders so it's slower going in and ordering but until the fix their online to where you can add notes and special requests that's my only option. Ordered my usual veggie quesadilla and my daughter got the kids meal with a side of queso. Get home and disgusted by the food quality. Just amazed since this is unlike Chipotle!

Finally I got my food and got home. Unfortunately when I got home I discovered that they had put lettuce tomato sour cream cheese and everything that I had requested to be left off still on the tacos so basically I had no edible food and my entire Cinco de Mayo food was ruined.

When I first walked into the place, the door and the floor was extremely sticky. It literally felt like they mopped the floor with syrup lol. Then the food was less to be desired. The flavor was awful and was packed full of grease. So greasy that the tortillas were soggy.  They were also out of chicken, and no fried foods, so I had to change my plans of what I wanted to order.  I ended up ordering a quesadilla and my friend ordered tacos.  Both horrible. Once I got my food, I went to the salsa bar to get some to go sauces and there were 2 lizards on the salsa cups and stands the cups were in.

I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt so I tried them a second time. I ordered Nachos and a quesadilla. The nachos had low quality ground beef and a drop of queso, saddest nachos I've ever had. The quesadilla was just meat or at least all I could taste and was almost burnt. I didn't realize it only came with rice OR beans so when I said chicken quesadilla with rice and beans they charged extra. $3 extra for a small amount of rice.... WHAT?

Server was unfriendly as can be, never cracked a smile and barely spoke. 

I don't understand the 4 star rating. I work too hard to waste my hard earned money at a place that is obviously concerned with food cost over value. For example, the chicken nachos had 3 tiny bites of chicken. The steak burrito had shaved pieces of beef, at most 1.5 ounces of beef in the burrito. They fill the burrito with cheap rice and canned black beans, and add cheese sauce so people believe they are getting a good value due to its size. The food cost on that burrito is barely even 10%. My Dad owns a restaurant in the Florida Panhandle, his food cost is almost 40% and it shows. I know what I'm getting when I dine out and can handle things not being perfect, I care about entrepreneurs trying their best in hard times. I don't like when I see something like this. Cheap ingredients that are overpriced is not the right way to do business.",-0.7754
"*Long rant post* 

Absolutely annoyed beyond belief with the Capital Tacos quick service located within Tuva. 
My fiancé ordered a kids quesadilla meal, an order of chips and queso and one monster quesadilla with chicken. 
There were 4 people ""working"" at the time the order was placed, one person waiting for their food, and one person ahead of us to order. 
As a quick service food option, the service was not quick. As in, my 5 year old had enough time for us to get the smallest jerimiah ice and eat the entire thing before our food was ready, slow! 
My fiancé took the food. He did not check it. That's on him/us because I didn't mention it either. Regardless of him/us not checking it, all of our items should have been there. They were not. Since he had to be to work in Lakeland by 3, he did not have time to go back over and deal with it. 
I called there 3 times prior to leaving to go back down there, Immediately upon getting into the house and seeing that there was food missing. No answer, the phone rings and rings and rings and there is no voicemail or option to leave a message. 
Once I got back to Capital Tacos with my five year old, I brought all the food back in and set it on the counter. Two employees stared at me and then proceed to go about their business of I'm not sure what as there was no one waiting for food, no food being cooked, and presumably not much for them to be doing. 
One of employees says hi, so I proceed to explain that we had just been in and that we did not receive the monster  quesadilla with chicken that we ordered. To which the other employee states ""well you should have."" I did not snap although honestly I wanted to with that kind of a response to a problem with food ordered while she had been there when we ordered. I only thought in my head, Really??? I should have? No kidding! I should have but I didn't and instead of having some smart remark that essentially accuses me of lying about what I received, there should have been a comment asking how they could fix it or an offer to fix it. I also explained that I called there three times and their phone simply rings and rings. The reply I got for that wasn't even a real word but more of a hmm because obviously they're also perplexed as to how the phone works as well. 
I was asked if I wanted it remade. I really did not since my fiancé had already left to go to work and I didn't want it. She asked if I wanted it credited back to the card but since he paid with his card, I asked if they needed the same card to do the return. She replied with ""I honestly have no idea."" 
I took the remade quesadilla. The fact that it was remade is really not the point. The employees are not attentive, they have zero customer service, and quite honestly if any of the business owners in here ever wonder what really drives their business into the ground, it's employees like this. The queso was congealed since it had been sitting throughout this entire ordeal. My child's food is cold, obviously for the same reason. And we have a chicken quesadilla that appears to be well done sitting hostage in the refrigerator until my fiancé eats it.  They remade the food ordered, they did not actually make the situation right. There was little by way of even an apology. I couldn't have it refunded, which is what I wanted to do because they clearly didn't know how to do a refund. Terrible experience. if I could give this establishment 0 stars, I would.",-0.9488

Horrible attitude by the staff and constantly out of selections on the menu.  I'm through with this place, which is a shame because we used to LOVE the other locations.

No apology, no sense of urgency, and the place was just about emptied of the 3 customers that came after I arrived.

When getting drinks there was a sign that they were out of Coke and Diet Coke so that was just icing on the cake. Not to mention that my bag of chips hardly had any in there. Yet again disappointed with service. Will continue to eat Chipotle because I love it although I get frustrated quite a bit.",-0.8119
"Garbage, 3rd time turned away before business hours end??? If you can do it right change your hours? You literally subtract from good business in a this  neighborhood. Sad, as you once added to it.
Oh, that was the original owners.
Food gets skimpier as time goes on and service from new employees blows ass. No lie. Worst Choice in Tampa.",-0.8645
"I made a huge mistake stopping here.  Taco Bell is usually fast food- in and out but I was in the drive through line about 25 min and the girl at the window was not friendly.  I guess I can't blame her but still....",-0.3045
"Slowest drive through in the world. Not sure what is happening inside as t 1:40pm, but they can't get their act together. Needs new management.",-0.1232
"We love coming here because the food is always good but the service was horrible. The servers ignored us all night And the manager was extremely rude. would not recommend coming here. Would assume the manger would come and check with us to see what the problem was but never did. Immediately kicked us out when his servers were rude to us.",-0.965
"Poor service, and shockingly can't figure out how to make a quesadilla.  How does a ""taqueria"" not know how to make a quesadilla?  We understood and ordered something else for our 4 and 2 year olds anyway, and as we walked away, the woman (Lindsey) started talking trash about us.  After we turned back around and asked what she said, she stood by it and kept talking trash to us and our little kids.  We cancelled the order and walked off.  Go to Jotoro instead, which is about 70ft away. 

Only a 1 star because you can't rate a zero.",-0.6743
"We had a big issue with someone else order being sent to us TWICE back to back!! We tried to call chipotle to see if our order was still at the store & they won't answer the phone. We have tried twice and it just rings and rings. So unprofessional. I understand it can get busy but you should also have someone answering the phones. Ridiculous.",-0.7295
"loud music and rude server at dinner. Hard to hear the person next to me. I love live music but I came to eat and socialize, not be at a concert. Lower the volume!.

Came to eat around 10pm think their kitchen closes at 11. Serve was so rude rushing us to order. Server literally came up to us awkwardly while we are all still eating around 10:30 and asked to get anything off the table while we literally have food on our plates. Idk what her issue is, maybe we were her last table. But awful attitude from the server from the beginning. 

Ehh, tried this place but other places around tampa have better vibes.",-0.8858
"Not happy with whoever took my order this afternoon over the phone. Rudest attitude. Put me on hold for 5 minutes. Please I'd advise whoever is managing the chipotle store on n sale mabry carrolwood to take care of this issue",-0.2495
